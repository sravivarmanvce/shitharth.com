 abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) bolstered the smart health care industry in present times by enabling quicker patient monitoring and disease diagnosis. However, there have been problems that need to be resolved using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. The major goal of this endeavor is to develop an IoMT-based data fusion system for multi-sensor smart healthcare network. To do this, a new optimization and deep learning approaches are being used in this work. In this research work, a unique smart healthcare framework, Tasmanian and Lichtenberg Optimized Attention Deep Convolution (TasLA) is developed for IoMT systems. This system uses an intelligent data fusion algorithms for collecting of medical data and the diagnosis of disorders. Here, data pretreatment and normalization processes are carried out in order to provide a dataset with balanced attribute information. The qualities or characteristics that will aid in classification are then selected using the most modern Tasmanian Devil Optimization (TDO) approach. The Attention Deep Convolution Classification (ADCC) algorithm is also used to classify the medical condition, thereby improving classification precision and reducing false predictions. To optimally compute the loss function during prediction, the Lichtenberg Optimization (LO) technique is employed to enhance classification performance. The effectiveness and results of the proposed TasLA model are validated and contrasted using various benchmark datasets such as Hungarian, Cleveland, Echocardiogram, and Z-Alizadeh.},
