abstract: In the current-generation wireless systems, there is a huge requirement
  on integrating big data which can able to predict the market trends of all application
  systems. Therefore, the proposed method emphasizes on the integration of nanosensors
  with big data analysis which will be used in healthcare applications. Also, safety
  precautions are considered when this nanosensor is integrated where depth and reflection
  of signals are also observed using different time samples. In addition, to analyze
  the effect of nanosensors, six fundamental scenarios that provide good impact on
  real-time applications are also deliberated. Moreover, for proving the adeptness
  of the proposed method, the results are equipped in both online and offline analyses
  for investigating error measurement, sensitivity, and permeability parameters. Since
  nanosensors are introduced, the efficiency of the projected technique is increased
  by implementing media access control (MAC) protocol with recurrent neural network
  (RNN). Further, after observing the simulation results, it is proved that the proposed
  method is more effective for an average percentile of 67% when compared to the existing
  methods.
