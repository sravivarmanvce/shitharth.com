abstract: Identifying objects in aircraft monitoring systems poses significant challenges
  due to the presence of extreme loading conditions. Despite the presence of several
  sensor units, the transmission of precise data to multiple data units is hindered
  by an increase in time intervals. Therefore, the suggested methodology is specifically
  developed for the purpose of generating digital replicas for aeronautical applications,
  wherein an aero transfer function is correlated with the digital twins. Mapping
  functions are utilized in the monitoring of diverse parameters that are associated
  with the identification of objects inside data transmission networks, with the aim
  of minimizing uncertainty. The suggested system model is enhanced by incorporating
  analytical representations and deep learning methods, resulting in the provision
  of zero point twin functionalities. The present study investigates the aforementioned
  integrated procedure through the analysis of four different situations. In these
  settings, an aero communication tool box is employed to transform the device configuration
  into simulation outputs. The results obtained from the comparison of these scenarios
  reveal that the projected model significantly enhances the maintenance period while
  minimizing data errors.
