abstract: In former cohort most of the applications that are designed for examining
  the effect of underground water for naval operations follows a specific path for
  all types of mission operations. But the development and success of such process
  is usually carried out using specification in score type maneuvers. However the
  effect of naval operation can only be examined in real time by using a well-defined
  bi-conditional statement system that integrates the communication device for choosing
  intelligent route. Therefore a fuzzy logic system is implemented for observing the
  effect of underwater applications using a defined system model. But unlike in existing
  models the sonar type model with data handling technique is not used but a secured
  data transfer approach is created using the constraint statements. Further to prove
  the effectiveness of the developed system with fuzzy logic five scenarios are described
  with performance analysis where the outcomes proves that projected method provides
  high effectiveness for about 67% as compared to existing method.
