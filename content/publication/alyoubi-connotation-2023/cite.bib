 abstract = {In former cohort most of the applications that are designed for examining the effect of underground water for naval operations follows a specific path for all types of mission operations. But the development and success of such process is usually carried out using specification in score type maneuvers. However the effect of naval operation can only be examined in real time by using a well-defined bi-conditional statement system that integrates the communication device for choosing intelligent route. Therefore a fuzzy logic system is implemented for observing the effect of underwater applications using a defined system model. But unlike in existing models the sonar type model with data handling technique is not used but a secured data transfer approach is created using the constraint statements. Further to prove the effectiveness of the developed system with fuzzy logic five scenarios are described with performance analysis where the outcomes proves that projected method provides high effectiveness for about 67% as compared to existing method.},
