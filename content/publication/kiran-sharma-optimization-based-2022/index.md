abstract: Generally, cellular networks are divided into discrete geographic zones
  where a secure routing protocol is important. In this study, Sailfish-based Distributed
  IP Mobility Management (SbDMM) architecture for security protocol in a smart home
  using 5G is suggested. Smart homes first gathered data via IoT devices which are
  then communicated with the use of a Home Gateway (HGW). Mobile Nodes (MN) and Corresponding
  Nodes (CN) process data communication (CN). In addition, the acquired data are encrypted
  and secured using the session key. Additionally, use an authenticated key and a
  cipher key to secure the routing optimization. As a result, the fitness of sailfish
  is updated in a protocol path that is optimized for securing data from attackers.
  The designed framework is then implemented in Python and the obtained results are
  compared to those of other methodologies in terms of execution time, confidentiality
  rate, efficiency, delay, and task completion.
