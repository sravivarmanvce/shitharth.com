 abstract = {In recent years the process of transportation needs a highly effective traffic system in order to monitor all consumer goods as many goods are left out at different locations. To handle such moving cases cloud platform is highly helpful as with respect to geographical location the goods are mapped in correct form. However incorporation of single cloud platform does not provide sufficient amount of storage about all goods thus a multiple cloud platform is introduced in proposed system. As multiple cloud platform is provided the security features of each data base system is also checked and enhanced using encryption keys. Moreover for proper operating conditions of multiple cloud platforms an analytical model is designed that synchronizes necessary data at end system. The defined analytical model focuses on solving multiple objectives that are related to critical energy problems where demand problems are reduced. Further the encryption process is carried out using Improved BlowFish Algorithm (IBFA) by allocating proper resources with decryption keys. To validate the effectiveness of proposed method five scenarios are considered where all scenario outcomes proves to be much higher than existing models by an average of 43%.},
