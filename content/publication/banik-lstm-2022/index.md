abstract: Due to the highly volatile and fluctuating nature of the Indian stock market
  which is influenced by a number of factors including government policies, release
  of a company’s financial reports, investor’s sentiment, geopolitical situation,
  and many others, the prediction of the stock market has been a daunting task for
  traders. In this study, a Long Short Term Memory enforced Decision Support System
  is developed for swing traders to accurately analyze and predict the future stock
  values. The Decision support system generates a report which incorporates the predicted
  values of the company stock for the next 30 days and other technical indicators
  like MFI, relative RSI, the Support and Resistance of the stock price, five Fibonacci
  retracement levels, and the MACD and SIGNAL LINE analysis of the company and NIFTY
  industry average stock price. The trader can use the investment success score calculated
  in the report to augment his investment decisions. The results achieved by the proposed
  model in terms of Root Mean Square Error, Mean absolute error, and Mean Absolute
  Percentage Error are 4.13, 3.24, and 1.21 % respectively which establishes the efficacy
  of the proposed technique compared with the state-of-art techniques.
