abstract: In the meantime, technology is reaching every domain. In the software industry,
  Automobiles, Education, Sports, Cinema technology is molding as a backbone to solve
  problems quickly and effectively. Technology is even used in the medical field.
  In pandemic situations, online medication is playing a crucial role. Technology
  can even be used in the agriculture field to identify crop diseases, which is a
  major problem for farmers. Even it spoils the environment to a great extent. Due
  to these, farmers are suffering huge losses. There are many reasons for this like
  the usage of more pesticides as these are very toxic and dangerous. If the diseases
  are predicted before, then these crop diseases can be removed or killed at the starting
  stage without causing much crop damage. Some people like experts can determine the
  disease by looking at the crop, that is by seeing external symptoms. But farmers
  don&apos;t have the connection with the experts. Our project deals with overcoming
  this problem by using concepts of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The
  project goal is to predict crop disease. Farmers can use this project to predict
  crop disease at an earlier stage and get steps to remove the disease. We will develop
  an android app and a website that takes the cropped photo as input. Farmers should
  upload the affected crop images in the app, so those experts will observe the symptoms
  and predict the diseases. Here, the project interacts with experts and gets the
  required solutions. In the absence of experts, an Artificial Intelligence model
  is trained with the algorithm. This AI model learns from the images uploaded and
  the expert&apos;s instructions to predict the output with more accuracy. Here the
  cloud is used to save images uploaded by users. AI models are subjected to a large
  number of datasets that contain disease data and predict the output. The output
  is then validated by experts to evaluate the correctness of the output.
