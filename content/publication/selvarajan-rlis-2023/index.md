abstract: This study explores the feasibility of allocating finite resources beyond
  fifth generation networks for extended reality applications through the implementation
  of enhanced security measures via offloading analysis (RLIS). The quantification
  of resources is facilitated through the utilization of parameters, namely energy,
  capacity, and power, which are equipped with proximity constraints. These constraints
  are then integrated with activation functions in both multilayer perceptron and
  long short term memory models. Furthermore, the system model has been developed
  using vision-based computing, which involves managing data queues in terms of waiting
  periods to minimize congestion for data transmission with limited resources. The
  major significance of the proposed method is to utilize allocated spectrums for
  future generation networks by allocating necessary resources and therefore high
  usage of resources by all users can be avoided. In addition the advantage of the
  proposed method is secure the networks that operate beyond 5G where more number
  of users will try to share the allocated resources that needs to be provided with
  high security conditions.
