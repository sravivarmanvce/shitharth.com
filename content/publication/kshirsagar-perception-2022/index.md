abstract: The majority of the current-generation individuals all around the world
  are dealing with a variety of health-related issues. The most common cause of health
  problems has been found as depression, which is caused by intellectual difficulties.
  However, most people are unable to recognize such occurrences in them, and no procedures
  for discriminating them from normal people have been created so far. Even some advanced
  technologies do not support distinct classes of individuals as language writing
  skills vary greatly across numerous places, making the central operations cumbersome.
  As a result, the primary goal of the proposed research is to create a unique model
  that can detect a variety of diseases in humans, thereby averting a high level of
  depression. A machine learning method known as the Convolutional Neural Network
  (CNN) model has been included into this evolutionary process for extracting numerous
  features in three distinct units. The CNN also detects early-stage problems since
  it accepts input in the form of writing and sketching, both of which are turned
  to images. Furthermore, with this sort of image emotion analysis, ordinary reactions
  may be easily differentiated, resulting in more accurate prediction results. The
  characteristics such as reference line, tilt, length, edge, constraint, alignment,
  separation, and sectors are analyzed to test the usefulness of CNN for recognizing
  abnormalities, and the extracted features provide an enhanced value of around 74%higher
  than the conventional models.
