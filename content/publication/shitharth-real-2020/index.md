abstract: Air pollution is a serious problem in thickly populated and industrialized
  areas. Economic growth and industrialization are proceeding at a rapid pace, accompanied
  by increasing emissions of air due to automobile vehicles, industries are the polluting
  sources. Environmental impacts of air pollutants have impact on public health, vegetation,
  material deterioration etc. To prevent or minimize the damage caused by atmospheric
  pollution, suitable RFID based cloud based monitoring systems are urgently needed
  that can rapidly and reliably detect and quantify polluting sources.&nbsp;Cloud
  computing based IOT module attached with Nano sensor and frequency&nbsp;identification
  emerges&nbsp;together&nbsp;to find the solution for the Air pollution control in
  automobile vehicles. All the pollution control monitoring data will be stored in
  common think speak cloud database. &nbsp;The IOT based RFID sensor module is placed
  in toll booth collection centre and traffic light signal area. When the vehicle
  cross any traffic light signal and toll booth area by using our proposed project
  module it will check the pollution exhaustion level of the vehicle and update the
  information in the cloud database. If the vehicle exhibits more exhaustion of gas
  it intimates to the particular police station and to the owner of the vehicle about
  the over exhaustion of gases in his vehicle. In India Air Pollution realed issues
  are doubled every year due to increase in population. Here we tried to control the
  air Pollution caused by the Motor Vehicles related issues by the latest IOT based
  RFID technology using nano sensors. RFID reader and monitoring hardware is placed
  in all the traffic signals, Toll Gates and Parking areas. It reads the tag while
  the vehicle crossing the system and checks the date expiry of insurance and smoke
  test status. If any issues, it will alert the traffic moderators. Then necessary
  action will be taken by traffic and transport control department
