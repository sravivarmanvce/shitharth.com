abstract: Cervical cancer affects nearly 4% of the women across the globe and leads
  to mortality if not treated in early stage. A few decades before, the mortality
  rate was too high when compared to the present statistics. This is achieved as nowadays
  most of women are aware of this disease and undergo health examination mainly for
  screening cervical cancer on regular basis. But only the accurate diagnosis can
  be helpful for further treatment. Many works are carried out for accurate diagnosis
  and always have some limitations in accurate predictions. In this work, an efficient
  algorithm is proposed for the accurate diagnosis of cervical cancer. A meta-heuristic
  called artificial Jellyfish search optimizer (JS) algorithm is combined with artificial
  neural network (ANN) to tackle this problem. The proposed algorithm is called JellyfishSearch_ANN
  and is employed to classify the cervical cancer dataset with four type of targets
  based on the examination. The JellyfishSearch_ANN provides outstanding results among
  other classifiers taken for comparison and mainly its classification accuracy is
  found to be above 98.87% for all targets.
