abstract: In recent days, all networks are connected by internet and all people around
  the world are able to control things in their remote locations. Even though these
  technologies have been used only by selected people, it is definite in the future
  that all people will use this technology and they will move towards building smart
  cities, homes, and industries. However, when advanced technologies are created,
  people always worry about security when they move towards smart environment. If
  the internet is connected to their home then much valuable information in their
  home can also be sent through smart devices. Therefore, for this IoT-based technology,
  a blockchain-based method can be introduced where more security for data transfer
  process can be provided. Also, these technologies have to work efficiently by integrating
  a new artificial intelligence-based machine learning algorithm. Therefore, for this,
  a deep learning model will be integrated, thus providing effective data transfer
  from transmitter to receiver.
