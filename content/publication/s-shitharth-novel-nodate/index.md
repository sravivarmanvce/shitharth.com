abstract: In a neural network, for classifying any high dimensional data, SOM (Self
  Organizing Maps) is highly preferred. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are unsupervised
  neural networks that cluster high dimensional data and transform complex inputs
  into easily understandable inputs. It works on data sets and used to find previously
  unknown patterns. Patterns help in categorizing elements for finding an association
  between them. They can detect the adversaries and defects in the data. Neural networks
  are considered as one of the prolific unsupervised learning methods which are a
  fast, and powerful technique that can be used to solve many real-world problems.
  These networks are widely used for data representation. An unsupervised algorithm
  has to understand the patterns in the data and then further process the desired
  output. This research proposes a modified neural network algorithm called MUSOM
  (mutated Self Organizing Maps). This algorithm has two major conjectures based on
  attacker\"s response on incoming packets from SCADA sensor. It has two components
  1.nodes and 2.neurons. These nodes and neurons are interconnected with each other.
  One is used to accomplish fault tolerance, error correction and.dimensionality reduction
  concerning the unknown anomalies. The next one is to find the outlying anomalies
  in the network.
