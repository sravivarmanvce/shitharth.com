abstract: Robotic technology holds a significant role within the realm of smart industries,
  wherein all functionalities are executed within real-time systems. The verification
  of robot operations is a crucial aspect in the context of Industry 5.0. To address
  this requirement, a distinctive design methodology known as SL-RI is proposed. This
  article aims to establish the significance of incorporating robots in the Industry
  5.0 framework through analytical representations. In the context of this industrial
  monitoring system, the implementation of a supplementary algorithm is essential
  for effective management, as it enables the robots to acquire knowledge through
  the analysis and adaptation of restructured commands. The analytical model of robots
  is designed to accurately monitor the precise position and accelerations of robots,
  resulting in full-scale representations with minimal error conditions. The uniqueness
  of the proposed method in robotic monitoring system is related to the application
  process that is directly applied in Industry 5.0 by using various parametric cases
  where active movement of robots are monitored with rotational matrix representations.
  In this type of representations the significance relies in the way to understand
  the full movement of robots across various machines and its data handling characteristics
  that provides low loss and error factors.
