 abstract = {Robotic technology holds a significant role within the realm of smart industries, wherein all functionalities are executed within real-time systems. The verification of robot operations is a crucial aspect in the context of Industry 5.0. To address this requirement, a distinctive design methodology known as SL-RI is proposed. This article aims to establish the significance of incorporating robots in the Industry 5.0 framework through analytical representations. In the context of this industrial monitoring system, the implementation of a supplementary algorithm is essential for effective management, as it enables the robots to acquire knowledge through the analysis and adaptation of restructured commands. The analytical model of robots is designed to accurately monitor the precise position and accelerations of robots, resulting in full-scale representations with minimal error conditions. The uniqueness of the proposed method in robotic monitoring system is related to the application process that is directly applied in Industry 5.0 by using various parametric cases where active movement of robots are monitored with rotational matrix representations. In this type of representations the significance relies in the way to understand the full movement of robots across various machines and its data handling characteristics that provides low loss and error factors.},
