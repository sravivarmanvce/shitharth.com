abstract: Due to the enormous data sizes involved in mobile computing and multimedia
  data transfer, it is possible that more data traffic may be generated, necessitating
  the use of data compression. As a result, this paper investigates how mobile computing
  data are compressed under all transmission scenarios. The suggested approach integrates
  deep neural networks (DNN) at high weighting functionalities for compression modes.
  The proposed method employs appropriate data loading and precise compression ratios
  for successful data compression. The accuracy of multimedia data that must be conveyed
  to various users is higher even though compression ratios are higher. The same data
  are transferred at significantly higher compression ratios, which save time while
  also minimizing data mistakes that may occur at the receiver. The DNN process also
  includes a visible parameter for handling high data-weight situations. The visible
  parameter optimizes the data results, allowing simulation tools to readily observe
  the compressed data. A comparison case study was created for five different scenarios
  in order to confirm the results, and it shows that the suggested strategy is significantly
  more effective than existing methods in roughly 63 percent of the cases.
