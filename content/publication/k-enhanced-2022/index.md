abstract: In Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are unsupervised neural networks that cluster
  high dimensional data and transform complex inputs into easily understandable inputs.
  To find the closest distance and weight factor, it maps high dimensional input space
  to low dimensional input space. The Closest node to d...
