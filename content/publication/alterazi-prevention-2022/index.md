abstract: High security for physical items such as intelligent machinery and residential
  appliances is provided via the Internet of Things (IoT). The physical objects are
  given a distinct online address known as the Internet Protocol to communicate with
  the networkâ€™s external foreign entities through the Internet (IP). IoT devices are
  in danger of security issues due to the surge in hacker attacks during Internet
  data exchange. If such strong attacks are to create a reliable security system,
  attack detection is essential. Attacks and abnormalities such as user-to-root (U2R),
  denial-of-service, and data-type probing could have an impact on an IoT system.
  This article examines various performance-based AI models to predict attacks and
  problems with IoT devices with accuracy. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), genetic
  algorithms, and ant colony optimization were used to demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the suggested technique concerning four different parameters. The results of
  the proposed method employing PSO outperformed those of the existing systems by
  roughly 73 percent.
