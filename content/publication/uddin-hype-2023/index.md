abstract: Blockchain is a groundbreaking technology widely adopted in industrial applications
  for improving supply chain management (SCM). The SCM and logistics communities have
  paid close attention to the development of blockchain technology. The primary purpose
  of employing a blockchain for SCM is to lower production costs while enhancing the
  system’s security. In recent years, blockchain-related SCM research has drawn much
  interest, and it is fair to state that this technology is now the most promising
  option for delivering reliable services/goods in supply chain networks. This study
  uses rigorous methods to review the technical implementation aspects of SCM systems
  driven by Blockchain. To ensure the security of industrial applications, we primarily
  concentrated on developing SCM solutions with blockchain capabilities. In this study,
  the unique qualities of blockchain technology have been exploited to analyze the
  main effects of leveraging it in the SCM. Several security metrics are utilized
  to validate and compare the blockchain methodologies’ effectiveness in SCM. The
  blockchain may alter the supply chain to make it more transparent and efficient
  by creating a useful tool for strategic planning and enhancing connections among
  the customers, suppliers, and accelerators. Moreover, the performance of traditional
  and blockchain-enabled SCM systems is compared in this study based on the parameters
  of efficiency, execution time, security level, and latency.
