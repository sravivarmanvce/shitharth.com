abstract: Artificial intelligence is intelligence revealed by software, as opposed
  to natural intelligence. It is the science and technology of intelligent machinery.
  It is also a technology that functions like people on the computer. The IoT Internet
  of Things is a web-based object network that can communicate and share data. AI
  and IoT are combined to achieve a more effective IoT process, namely AIoT, combined
  with the Internet and artificial intelligence. Recently, an efficient health care
  system was introduced with artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT research. In this
  paper, the usability of artificial intelligence is discussed, and the implementation
  of AI and IoT analytics are systematically examined as a way of enhancing the health
  system in the IoT model. Different AI-based and device algorithms are also explored.
  Edge Computing is a modern computer technology in which data are processed from
  the edge. Simulation result shows the accuracy, precision and specificity of decision
  tree approach than SVM and Na√Øve Bayes. It offers lower bandwidth costs, more robust
  privacy and data security than cloud computing. Notably, advanced computing is easily
  used by artificial intelligence technologies.
