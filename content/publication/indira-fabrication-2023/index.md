abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in a variety of fields and has
  the potential to alter how we currently view farming. Due to its emphasis on effectiveness
  and usability artificial intelligence has the largest impact on agriculture of all
  industries. We highlight the automation-supporting technologies such as Artificial
  Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Long-Range (LoRa) technology which provides
  data integrity and protection. We also offer a structure for smart farming that
  depends on the location of data processing after a comprehensive investigation of
  numerous designs. As part of our future study we have divided the unresolved difficulties
  in smart agriculture into two categories such as networking issues and technology
  issues. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are examples of technologies
  whereas the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite and LoRa are
  used for all network-related jobs. The goal of the research is to deploy a network
  of sensors throughout agricultural fields to gather real-time information on a variety
  of environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil moisture and nutrient
  levels. The seamless data transmission and communication made possible by these
  sensors’ integration with Internet of Things technologies. With the use of AI techniques
  and algorithms the gathered data is examined. The technology may offer practical
  insights and suggestions for improving agricultural practices because the AI models
  are trained to spot patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data. We are also
  focusing on indoor farming by supplying Ultra Violet radiation and artificial lighting
  in accordance with plant growth. When a pest assault is detected using AI and LoRa
  even in poor or no network coverage area and notifies the farmer’s mobile in any
  part of the world. The irrigation system is put to the test with various plants
  at various humidity and temperature levels in both dry and typical situations. To
  keep the water content in those specific regions soil moisture sensors are used.
