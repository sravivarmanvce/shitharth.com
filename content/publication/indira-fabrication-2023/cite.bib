 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in a variety of fields and has the potential to alter how we currently view farming. Due to its emphasis on effectiveness and usability artificial intelligence has the largest impact on agriculture of all industries. We highlight the automation-supporting technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Long-Range (LoRa) technology which provides data integrity and protection. We also offer a structure for smart farming that depends on the location of data processing after a comprehensive investigation of numerous designs. As part of our future study we have divided the unresolved difficulties in smart agriculture into two categories such as networking issues and technology issues. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are examples of technologies whereas the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite and LoRa are used for all network-related jobs. The goal of the research is to deploy a network of sensors throughout agricultural fields to gather real-time information on a variety of environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil moisture and nutrient levels. The seamless data transmission and communication made possible by these sensors’ integration with Internet of Things technologies. With the use of AI techniques and algorithms the gathered data is examined. The technology may offer practical insights and suggestions for improving agricultural practices because the AI models are trained to spot patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data. We are also focusing on indoor farming by supplying Ultra Violet radiation and artificial lighting in accordance with plant growth. When a pest assault is detected using AI and LoRa even in poor or no network coverage area and notifies the farmer’s mobile in any part of the world. The irrigation system is put to the test with various plants at various humidity and temperature levels in both dry and typical situations. To keep the water content in those specific regions soil moisture sensors are used.},
