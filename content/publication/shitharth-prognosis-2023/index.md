abstract: In the process of urban environment, the optimisation of network enactment
  is shifted from operation to maintenance and monitoring stage. During such conversion
  it is necessary to indicate the time series representation for preventing the overexploitation
  problem that happens due to more number of natural resources. It is necessary to
  use a set of historical data to check the behaviour of current state operations
  at varying time periods using an intelligent optimiser. Thus this study explores
  the implementation of time series analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) where
  accurate predictions are made in the entire urban environment even with big edifices.
  The major difference that is observed in the proposed method as compared to existing
  method is that two different boundary regions are chosen with distinct point values
  and only in two directions the monitoring device is installed. Since AI is involved
  in the entire process entire characteristics on forecasting current state procedure
  is represented using modified evolutionary optimisation (MEO) which observes entire
  biological nature of neighbouring environs. Additionally comparison analysis is
  made using MATLAB with five case studies where the proposed method proves to be
  much effective for about 70% as compared to existing models.
