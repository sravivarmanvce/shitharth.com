abstract: Abnormal human behavior must be monitored and controlled in todayâ€™s technology-driven
  era, since it may cause damage to society in the form of assault or web-based violence,
  such as direct harm to a person or the propagation of hate crimes through the internet.
  Several authors have attempted to address this issue, but no one has yet come up
  with a solution that is both practical and workable. Recently, deep learning models
  have become popular as a means of handling massive amounts of data but their potential
  to categorize the aberrant human activity remains unexplored. Using a convolutional
  neural network (CNN), a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), and an attention
  mechanism to pay attention to the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of raw video
  streams, a deep-learning approach has been implemented in the proposed framework
  to detect anomalous human activity. After analyzing the video, our suggested architecture
  can reliably assign an abnormal human behavior to its designated category. Analytic
  findings comparing the suggested architecture to state-of-the-art algorithms reveal
  an accuracy of 98.9%, 96.04%, and 61.04% using the UCF11, UCF50, and subUCF crime
  datasets, respectively.
