abstract: The World Wide Web comprises of huge web databases where the data are searched
  using web query interface. Generally, the World Wide Web maintains a set of databases
  to store several data records. The distinct data records are extracted by the web
  query interface as per the user requests. The information maintained in the web
  database is hidden and retrieves deep web content even in dynamic script pages.
  In recent days, a web page offers a huge amount of structured data and is in need
  of various web-related latest applications. The challenge lies in extracting complicated
  structured data from deep web pages. Deep web contents are generally accessed by
  the web queries, but extracting the structured data from the web database is a complex
  problem. Moreover, making use of such retrieved information in combined structures
  needs significant efforts. No further techniques are established to address the
  complexity in data extraction of deep web data from various web pages. Despite the
  fact that several ways for deep web data extraction are offered, very few research
  address template-related issues at the page level. For effective web data extraction
  with a large number of online pages, a unique representation of page generation
  using tree-based pattern matches (TBPM) is proposed. The performance of the proposed
  technique TBPM is compared to that of existing techniques in terms of relativity,
  precision, recall, and time consumption. The performance metrics such as high relativity
  is about 17-26% are achieved when compared to FiVaTech approach.
