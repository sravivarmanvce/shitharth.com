 abstract = {Today, many people under the age of 10 are being examined for brain-related issues, including tumours, without displaying any symptoms. It is not unusual for children to develop brain-related concerns such as tumours and central nervous system disorders, which may affect 15% of the population. Medical experts believe that the irregular eating habits (junk food) and the consumption of pesticide-tainted fruits and vegetables are to blame. The human body is naturally resistant to harmful gears, but only up to a point. If it exceeds the limit, a cell manipulation process is automatically initiated that can remove dangerous inactive tissues from the cell membrane and later grows into tumour blockage in the human body. Thus, the adoption of an advanced computer-based diagnostic system is highly recommended in order to generate visually enhanced images for anomaly identification and infectious tissue segmentation. In most cases, an MR image is chosen since it is easier to distinguish between affected and nonaffected tissue. Conventional convolution neural network (CCNN) mapping and feature extraction are difficult because of the vast volume of data. In addition, it takes a lengthy time for the MRI scanning process to obtain diverse positions for anomaly identification. Aside from the discomfort, the patient may experience motion abnormalities. Recurrent neural network (RNN) classifies tumour regions into several isolated portions much faster and more accurately, so that it can be prevented. To remove motion artefacts from dynamic multicontrast MR images, a novel long short-term memory- (LSTM-) based RNN framework is introduced in this research. With this method, the MR imageâ€™s visual quality is improved over CCNN while simultaneously mapping a larger volume and extracting more quiet characteristics than CCNN can. DC-CNN, SMSR-CNN, FMSI-CNN, and DRCA-CNN results are compared. For both low and high signal-to-noise ratios, the suggested LSTM-based RNN framework has gained reasonable feature intelligibility (SNRs). In comparison to previous approaches, it requires less computing and has higher accuracy when it comes to detecting infected portions.},
