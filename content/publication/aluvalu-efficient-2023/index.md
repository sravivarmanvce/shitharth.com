abstract: In the medical era, wearables often manage and find the specific data points
  to check important data like resting heart rate, ECG voltage, SPO2, sleep patterns
  like length, interruptions, and intensity, and physical activity like kind, duration,
  and levels. These digital biomarkers are created mainly through passive data collection
  from various sensors. The critical issues with this method are time and sensitivity.
  We reviewed the newest wireless communication trends employed in hospitals using
  wearable technology and privacy and Block chain to solve this problem. Based on
  sensors, this wireless technology controls the data gathered from numerous locations.
  In this study, the wearable sensor contains data from the various departments of
  the system. The gradient boosting method and the hybrid microwave transmission method
  have been proposed to find the location and convince people. The patient health
  decision has been submitted to hybrid microwave transmission using gradient boosting.
  This will help to trace the mobile phones using the calls from the threatening person,
  and the data is gathered from the database while tracing. From this concern, the
  data analysis process is based on decision-making. They adapted the data encountered
  by the detailed data in the statistical modeling of the system to produce exploratory
  data analysis for satisfying the data from the database. Complete data is classified
  with a 97% outcome by removing unwanted data and making it a 98% successful data
  classification.
