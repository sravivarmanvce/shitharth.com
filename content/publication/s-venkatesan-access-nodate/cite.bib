 abstract = {In Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technology, access point selection at each Station is a critical problem in order to obtain satisfactory throughput and bandwidth. The traffic load of WLANs is often unevenly distributed among the Access Points (APs) which result unfair bandwidth allocation among Mobile Users (MUs). In this paper. the proposed algorithm has been presented as an efficient Solution to determine the Mobile User (MU)-Access Point (AP) associations for better bandwidth allocation of MUs and better throughput. Load balancing procedure namely Load Balancing Algorithm (LBA), which acts in two separate levels. First that will maintain load of the APs are fair when new MU is going to be joined and second is whenever the existing MU is going to be relieved. The experimental results of the proposed algorithm indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves Performance improvements in throughput and bandwidth allocation compared with previous algorithms.},
