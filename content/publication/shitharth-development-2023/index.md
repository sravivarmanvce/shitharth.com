abstract: The edge computing method and Internet of Things (IoT), which offers significantly
  shorter inactivity intervals, is one of the promising network technologies in today's
  generation of systems. There is no need to process the data using a cloud platform
  whenever an edge computing technology is used; alternative ways employing offline
  IoT and incremental learning techniques can be used. Using IoT, the incremental
  learning process transfers all essential data within a specific device. Thus, edge
  computing, IoT and incremental learning techniques are combined in the proposed
  method to detect numerous objects with varying weights. An analytical model that
  minimizes the parametric values and has various objectives is used to carry out
  the object detection process. Additionally, by utilizing evaluation metrics from
  five different case studies that were simulated using the MATLAB computing toolkit,
  the proposed method was tested. The efficacy of the proposed method rises to 62%
  when the simulated results are compared with the current method. The suggested method
  can accurately identify several objects in real-time when operating in a multi-object
  mode.
