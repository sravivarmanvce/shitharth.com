abstract: The security concerns surrounding edge computing have been in the forefront
  as the technology has become increasingly popular. There is a larger need to move
  computations to edge servers as more and more IoT applications that take advantage
  of edge computing are developed. Security at the periphery of information transmission
  in the Internet of Things is essential. In this work we introduce a multi-attack
  IDS for edge-assisted IoT that combines the back propagation (BP) Neural Network
  with the Radial basis function (RBF) Neural Network. Specifically, we employ a BP
  neural network to spot outliers and zero down on the most important characteristics
  for each attack methodology. A neural network based on radial basis functions (RBF)
  is used to spot multi-attack intrusions. The findings demonstrate great accuracy
  in the given multiattack scenario, demonstrating the potential and efficiency of
  our proposed anomaly detection methodology.
