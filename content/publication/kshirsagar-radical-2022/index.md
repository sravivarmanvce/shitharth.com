abstract: Due to air pollution, pollutants that harm humans and other species, as
  well as the environment and natural resources, can be detected in the atmosphere.
  In real-world applications, the following impurities that are caused due to smog,
  nicotine, bacteria, yeast, biogas, and carbon dioxide occur uninterruptedly and
  give rise to unavoidable pollutants. Weather, transportation, and the combustion
  of fossil fuels are all factors that contribute to air pollution. Uncontrolled fire
  in parts of grasslands and unmanaged construction projects are two factors that
  contribute to air pollution. The challenge of assessing contaminated air is critical.
  Machine learning algorithms are used to forecast the surroundings if any pollution
  level exceeds the corresponding limit. As a result, in the proposed method air pollution
  levels are predicted using a machine learning technique where a computer-aided procedure
  is employed in the process of developing technological aspects to estimate harmful
  element levels with 99.99% accuracy. Some of the models used to enhance forecasts
  are Mean Square Error (MSE), Coefficient of Determination Error (CDE), and R Square
  Error (RSE).
