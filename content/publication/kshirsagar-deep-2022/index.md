abstract: Skin problems are among the most common ailments on Earth. Despite its popularity,
  assessing it is not easy because of the complexities in skin tones, hair colors,
  and hairstyles. Skin disorders provide a significant public health risk across the
  globe. They become dangerous when they enter the invasive phase. Dermatological
  illnesses are a significant concern for the medical community. Because of increased
  pollution and poor diet, the number of individuals with skin disorders is on the
  rise at an alarming rate. People often overlook the early signs of skin illness.
  The current approach for diagnosing and treating skin conditions relies on a biopsy
  process examined and administered by physicians. Human assessment can be avoided
  with a hybrid technique, thus providing hopeful findings on time. Approaches to
  a thorough investigation indicate that deep learning methods might be used to construct
  frameworks capable of identifying diverse skin conditions. Skin and non-skin tissue
  must be distinguished to detect skin diseases. This research developed a skin disease
  classification system using MobileNetV2 and LSTM. For this system, accuracy in skin
  disease forecasting is the primary aim while ensuring excellent efficiency in storing
  complete state information for exact forecasts.
