 abstract = {Skin problems are among the most common ailments on Earth. Despite its popularity, assessing it is not easy because of the complexities in skin tones, hair colors, and hairstyles. Skin disorders provide a significant public health risk across the globe. They become dangerous when they enter the invasive phase. Dermatological illnesses are a significant concern for the medical community. Because of increased pollution and poor diet, the number of individuals with skin disorders is on the rise at an alarming rate. People often overlook the early signs of skin illness. The current approach for diagnosing and treating skin conditions relies on a biopsy process examined and administered by physicians. Human assessment can be avoided with a hybrid technique, thus providing hopeful findings on time. Approaches to a thorough investigation indicate that deep learning methods might be used to construct frameworks capable of identifying diverse skin conditions. Skin and non-skin tissue must be distinguished to detect skin diseases. This research developed a skin disease classification system using MobileNetV2 and LSTM. For this system, accuracy in skin disease forecasting is the primary aim while ensuring excellent efficiency in storing complete state information for exact forecasts.},
