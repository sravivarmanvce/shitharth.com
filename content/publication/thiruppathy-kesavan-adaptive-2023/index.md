abstract: 'Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANET) facilitate inter-vehicle communication
  using their dedicated connection infrastructure. Numerous advantages and applications
  exist associated with this technology, with road safety particularly noteworthy.
  Ensuring the transportation and security of information is crucial in the majority
  of networks, similar to other contexts. The security of VANETs poses a significant
  challenge due to the presence of various types of attacks that threaten the communication
  infrastructure of mobile vehicles. This research paper introduces a new security
  scheme known as the Soft Computing-based Secure Protocol for VANET Environment (SC-SPVE)
  method, which aims to tackle security challenges. The SC-SPVE technique integrates
  an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimisation to identify
  different attacks in VANETs efficiently. The proposed SC-SPVE method yielded the
  following average outcomes: a throughput of 148.71 kilobits per second, a delay
  of 23.60 ms, a packet delivery ratio of 95.62%, a precision of 92.80%, an accuracy
  of 99.55%, a sensitivity of 98.25%, a specificity of 99.65%, and a detection time
  of 6.76 ms using the Network Simulator NS2.'
