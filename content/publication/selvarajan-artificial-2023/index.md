abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to deliver innovative
  business models across multiple domains by providing ubiquitous connectivity, intelligent
  data, predictive analytics, and decision-making systems for improved market performance.
  However, traditional IIoT architectures are highly susceptible to many security
  vulnerabilities and network intrusions, which bring challenges such as lack of privacy,
  integrity, trust, and centralization. This research aims to implement an Artificial
  Intelligence-based Lightweight Blockchain Security Model (AILBSM) to ensure privacy
  and security of IIoT systems. This novel model is meant to address issues that can
  occur with security and privacy when dealing with Cloud-based IIoT systems that
  handle data in the Cloud or on the Edge of Networks (on-device). The novel contribution
  of this paper is that it combines the advantages of both lightweight blockchain
  and Convivial Optimized Sprinter Neural Network (COSNN) based AI mechanisms with
  simplified and improved security operations. Here, the significant impact of attacks
  is reduced by transforming features into encoded data using an Authentic Intrinsic
  Analysis (AIA) model. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate this system
  using various attack datasets. In addition, the results of privacy protection and
  AI mechanisms are evaluated separately and compared using various indicators. By
  using the proposed AILBSM framework, the execution time is minimized to 0.6Â seconds,
  the overall classification accuracy is improved to 99.8%, and detection performance
  is increased to 99.7%. Due to the inclusion of auto-encoder based transformation
  and blockchain authentication, the anomaly detection performance of the proposed
  model is highly improved, when compared to other techniques.
