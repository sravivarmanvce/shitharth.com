abstract: This article emphasis the importance of constructing an underwater vehicle
  monitoring system to solve various issues that are related to deep sea explorations.
  For solving the issues, conventional methods are not implemented, whereas a new
  underwater vehicle is introduced which acts as a sensing device and monitors the
  ambient noise in the system. However, the fundamentals of creating underwater vehicles
  have been considered from conventional systems and the new formulations are generated.
  This innovative sensing device will function based on the energy produced by the
  solar cells which will operate for a short period of time under the water where
  low parametric units are installed. In addition, the energy consumed for operating
  a particular unit is much lesser and this results in achieving high reliability
  using a probabilistic path finding algorithm. Further, two different application
  segments have been solved using the proposed formulations including the depth of
  monitoring the ocean. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, comparisons
  have been made with existing methods in terms of navigation output units, rate of
  decomposition for solar cells, reliability rate, and directivity where the proposed
  method proves to be more efficient for an average percentile of 64%.
