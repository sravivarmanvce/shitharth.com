 abstract = {This article emphasis the importance of constructing an underwater vehicle monitoring system to solve various issues that are related to deep sea explorations. For solving the issues, conventional methods are not implemented, whereas a new underwater vehicle is introduced which acts as a sensing device and monitors the ambient noise in the system. However, the fundamentals of creating underwater vehicles have been considered from conventional systems and the new formulations are generated. This innovative sensing device will function based on the energy produced by the solar cells which will operate for a short period of time under the water where low parametric units are installed. In addition, the energy consumed for operating a particular unit is much lesser and this results in achieving high reliability using a probabilistic path finding algorithm. Further, two different application segments have been solved using the proposed formulations including the depth of monitoring the ocean. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, comparisons have been made with existing methods in terms of navigation output units, rate of decomposition for solar cells, reliability rate, and directivity where the proposed method proves to be more efficient for an average percentile of 64%.},
