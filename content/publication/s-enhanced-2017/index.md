abstract: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used
  in many applications including power transmission and distribution for situational
  awareness and control. Identifying and detecting intrusions in a SCADA is a critical
  and demanding task in recent days. For this purpose, various Intrusion Detection
  Systems (IDSs) are developed in the existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including
  it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted
  date and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to overcome
  all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo Search Optimization
  (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques
  are proposed in this paper. The main intention of this paper is to detect and classify
  the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input
  network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the
  clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the best attributes
  by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the intrusions in a network are
  classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA algorithm. The experimental results
  evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity,
  precision, recall, accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate.
