abstract: 'Background: In many medically developed applications, the process of early
  diagnosis in cases of pulmonary disease does not exist. Many people experience immediate
  suffering due to the lack of early diagnosis, even after becoming aware of breathing
  difficulties in daily life. Because of this, identifying such hazardous diseases
  is crucial, and the suggested solution combines computer vision and communication
  processing techniques. As computing technology advances, a more sophisticated mechanism
  is required for decision-making.  Objective: The major objective of the proposed
  method is to use image processing to demonstrate computer vision-based experimentation
  for identifying lung illness. In order to characterize all the uncertainties that
  are present in nodule segments, an improved support vector machine is also integrated
  into the decision-making process.  Methods: As a result, the suggested method incorporates
  an Improved Support Vector Machine (ISVM) with a clear correlation between various
  margins. Additionally, an image processing technique is introduced where all impacted
  sites are marked at high intensity to detect the presence of pulmonary syndrome.
  Contrary to other methods, the suggested method divides the image processing methodology
  into groups, making the loop generation process much simpler.  Results: Five situations
  are taken into account to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested technique,
  and test results are compared with those from existing models.  Conclusion: The
  proposed technique with ISVM produces 83 percent of successful results.'
