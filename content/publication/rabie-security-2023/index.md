abstract: Detection of cyber-threats in the smart grid Supervisory Control and Data
  Acquisition (SCADA) is still remains one of the complex and essential processes
  need to be highly concentrated in present times. Typically, the SCADA is more prone
  to the security issues due to their environmental problems and vulnerabilities.
  Therefore, the proposed work intends to design a new detection approach by integrating
  the optimization and classification models for smart grid SCADA security. In this
  framework, the min-max normalization is performed at first for noise removal and
  attributes arrangement. Here, the correlation estimation mechanism is mainly deployed
  to reduce the dimensionality of features by choosing the relevant features used
  for attack prediction. Moreover, the optimal features are selected by using the
  optimal solution provided by the Holistic Harris Hawks Optimization (H3O). Finally,
  the Perceptron Stochastic Neural Network (PSNN) is utilized to categorize the normal
  and attacking data flow in the network with minimal processing time and complexity.
  By using the combination of proposed H3O-PSNN technique, the detection accuracy
  is improved up to 99% for all datasets used in this study, and also other measures
  such as precision to 99.2%, recall to 99%, f1-score to 99.2% increased, when compared
  to the standard techniques.
