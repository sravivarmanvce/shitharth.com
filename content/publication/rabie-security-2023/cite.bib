 abstract = {Detection of cyber-threats in the smart grid Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is still remains one of the complex and essential processes need to be highly concentrated in present times. Typically, the SCADA is more prone to the security issues due to their environmental problems and vulnerabilities. Therefore, the proposed work intends to design a new detection approach by integrating the optimization and classification models for smart grid SCADA security. In this framework, the min-max normalization is performed at first for noise removal and attributes arrangement. Here, the correlation estimation mechanism is mainly deployed to reduce the dimensionality of features by choosing the relevant features used for attack prediction. Moreover, the optimal features are selected by using the optimal solution provided by the Holistic Harris Hawks Optimization (H3O). Finally, the Perceptron Stochastic Neural Network (PSNN) is utilized to categorize the normal and attacking data flow in the network with minimal processing time and complexity. By using the combination of proposed H3O-PSNN technique, the detection accuracy is improved up to 99% for all datasets used in this study, and also other measures such as precision to 99.2%, recall to 99%, f1-score to 99.2% increased, when compared to the standard techniques.},
