abstract: Nowadays, increasing numbers of malicious programs are becoming a serious
  problem, which increases the need for automated detection and categorization of
  potential threats. These attacks often use undetected malware that is not recognized
  by the security vendor, making it difficult to protect the endpoints from viruses.
  Existing methods have been proposed to detect malware. However, as malware variations
  develop, they can lead to misdiagnosis and are difficult to diagnose accurately.
  To address this problem, in this work introduces a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  to identify the malware or benign based on extract features using Information Gain
  Absolute Feature Selection (IGAFS) technique. First, Malware detection dataset is
  collected from kaggle repository. Then the proposed pre-process the dataset for
  removing null and noisy values to prepare the dataset. Next, the proposed Information
  Gain Absolute Feature Selection (IGAFS) technique is used to select most relevant
  features for malware from the pre-processed dataset. Selected features are trained
  into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method to classify as malware or not with better
  accuracy and false rate. The experimental result provides greater performance compared
  with previous methods.
