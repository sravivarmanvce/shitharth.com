 abstract = {In the process of drone development, most of the current state systems’ design is based on high-weight functionalities. Due to high-weight functionalities, it is observed that if the drone drops at a particular point, the entire design is fragmented. Also, well-defined functionalities of drones for a specific application can only be designed if radial functionalities are defined at proper angles. Therefore, this article addresses the issues present in the existing method using the CRA algorithm, where radial functions, represented in terms of input and hidden weighting functions, are explored utterly. Additionally, a novel analytical procedure that establishes the coverage area for the data transfer approach has been incorporated into the drones’ architecture. Additionally, employing motion signatures and a special identification system, the developed drone system can function along various paths. To evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested system, three scenarios are organized as a basic functionality model. With the right scattering ratio, the comparison inscriptions show that the proposed approach can achieve an 82% success rate.},
