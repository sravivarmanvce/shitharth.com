abstract: In the process of drone development, most of the current state systems’
  design is based on high-weight functionalities. Due to high-weight functionalities,
  it is observed that if the drone drops at a particular point, the entire design
  is fragmented. Also, well-defined functionalities of drones for a specific application
  can only be designed if radial functionalities are defined at proper angles. Therefore,
  this article addresses the issues present in the existing method using the CRA algorithm,
  where radial functions, represented in terms of input and hidden weighting functions,
  are explored utterly. Additionally, a novel analytical procedure that establishes
  the coverage area for the data transfer approach has been incorporated into the
  drones’ architecture. Additionally, employing motion signatures and a special identification
  system, the developed drone system can function along various paths. To evaluate
  the effectiveness of the suggested system, three scenarios are organized as a basic
  functionality model. With the right scattering ratio, the comparison inscriptions
  show that the proposed approach can achieve an 82% success rate.
