abstract: Industry control systems (ICS) are considered as one of the inevitable systems
  in this contemporary smart world. In that supervisory control and data acquisition
  (SCADA) is the centralized system that control the entire grid. When a system is
  considered to be a whole and sole control, obviously an uncompromised security would
  be the prime. By having that as a major concern, a lot of research is being done
  on IDS security. In spite of that it has several cons including increased fake positive
  and fake negative rates, which will invariably lead to a larger chaos. To get rid
  of these problems, a weighted-intrusion based cuckoo search (WI-CS) and graded neural
  network (GNN) methods are proposed in this chapter. The key purpose of this chapter
  is to identify and categorize the anomalies in a SCADA system through data optimization.
  At initial stage, the collected real-time SCADA dataset is given as input. Then,
  by using the aforementioned proposed machine learning algorithms, these data are
  clustered and optimized. Later to find, the type of intrusion will remain as a further
  challenge and for that we propose HNA-AA algorithm. The investigational results
  estimate the efficiency of the system by considering sensitivity, false detection
  rate, precision, recall, Jaccard, accuracy, dice and specificity.
