 abstract = {Smart grid doesn't have a single standard definition to define it. Commonly, Smart Grid is an incorporation of advanced technologies over the normal electrical grid. Smart grid provides some novel features that mainly includes two way communication and automatic self-healing capability. Like the Internet, the Smart Grid consists of many new technologies and equipment that are bind together. These technologies works with the electrical grid to respond digitally accordingly to our quickly changing electric demand. Even though it is stuffed with pros, it suffers a lot due to its fragile data security. Smart grid usually have a centralized control system called SCADA to monitor and maintain all the data sources. Attackers would always tend to sneak through this centralized system through numerous types of attacks. Since SCADA system has no definite protocol, it can be fixed into any kind of protocol that is required by the utility. In this paper, the proposed method provides two techniques one to detect and remove sniffers from the network. Another one is to safeguard the SCADA system from the DDoS attack. Promiscuous mode detection and MD-5 algorithm is used to find the sniffers and by analyzing the TTL values, DDoS attack is been identified and isolated. The proposed technique is also compared with a real time existing IDS tool to show its better bandwidth consumption.},
