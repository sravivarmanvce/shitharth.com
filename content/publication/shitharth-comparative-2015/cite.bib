 abstract = {Smart grid doesnâ€™t have a single standard definition to define it. Commonly, Smart Grid is an incorporation of advanced technologies over the normal electrical grid. Smart grid provides some novel features that mainly includes two way communication and automatic self-healing capability. Like Internet, Smart Grid also consists of many new technologies and equipment that are bind together. These technologies works with the electrical grid and respond digitally to our quickly changing electric demand. Even though it is stuffed with pros, it suffers a lot due to its fragile data security. Smart grid usually have a centralized control system called SCADA to monitor and maintain all the data sources. Attackers would always tend to sneak through this centralized system through numerous types of attacks. Since SCADA system has no definite protocol, it could be adopted with any kind of protocol that is required by the utility. Usually, there are certain tools which are commonly used in the IT and corporate systems. But how long it is compatible with SCADA network is always questionable In this paper, a comparison of countermeasure between the proposed methodology and the security tools (Wireshark, tcpdump) is been analyzed under Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) with Sniffing attacks . The security system apt for SCADA network is analyzed on the basis of bandwidth consumption and traffic analyzing capacity.},
