abstract: In recent years, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has arisen as a new computing
  platform that pushes computational power to the edge of the Internet and close to
  end users. Additionally, a rising number of scholars are performing various sorts
  of research within the framework of edge devices. The security risks of resource
  consumers are elevated since edge computing frequently lacks a centralized security
  mechanism, in contrast to cloud computing. Therefore, in this research, we focus
  on creating a reliable trust evaluation mechanism to overcome security concerns
  for enabling MEC successfully. As a result of their limited capacity for data storage
  and processing, these devices help pave the way for the emerging edge computing
  paradigm. Reputation data is processed locally on edge devices, with just the necessary
  data being transferred to the Cloud, which improves reliability and reduces the
  load on the network as a whole. There is a lack of trust amongst devices in the
  IoT because of the inherent security threats and assaults they face. To mitigate
  this threat, we offer a lightweight trust management model to oversee a deviceâ€™s
  trustworthiness and the trustworthiness of its service levels, as well as the quality
  of service those levels provide (QoS). In order to determine an aggregate level
  of trust, the model uses QoS characteristics as weights to evaluate the trust of
  devices. The enhanced outcomes of QoS-parameterized trust management models suggest
  that they may be useful for detecting malicious edge nodes in edge computing networks,
  which would have practical applications in industry.
