 abstract = {There can be many inherent issues in the process of managing cloud infrastructure and the platform of the cloud. The platform of the cloud manages cloud software and legality issues in making contracts. The platform also handles the process of managing cloud software services and legal contract-based segmentation. In this paper, we tackle these issues directly with some feasible solutions. For these constraints, the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) classifier and the SELECT Applicable Only to Parallel Server (SELECT-APSL ASA) method are proposed to separate the data related to the place. ASA is made up of the AODE and SELECT Applicable Only to Parallel Server. The AODE classifier is used to separate the data from smart city data based on the hybrid data obfuscation technique. The data from the hybrid data obfuscation technique manages 50% of the raw data, and 50% of hospital data is masked using the proposed transmission. The analysis of energy consumption before the cryptosystem shows the total packet delivered by about 71.66% compared with existing algorithms. The analysis of energy consumption after cryptosystem assumption shows 47.34% consumption, compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The average energy consumption before data obfuscation decreased by 2.47%, and the average energy consumption after data obfuscation was reduced by 9.90%. The analysis of the makespan time before data obfuscation decreased by 33.71%. Compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, the study of makespan time after data obfuscation decreased by 1.3%. These impressive results show the strength of our methodology.},
