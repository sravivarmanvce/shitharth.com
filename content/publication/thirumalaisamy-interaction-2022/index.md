abstract: There can be many inherent issues in the process of managing cloud infrastructure
  and the platform of the cloud. The platform of the cloud manages cloud software
  and legality issues in making contracts. The platform also handles the process of
  managing cloud software services and legal contract-based segmentation. In this
  paper, we tackle these issues directly with some feasible solutions. For these constraints,
  the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) classifier and the SELECT Applicable
  Only to Parallel Server (SELECT-APSL ASA) method are proposed to separate the data
  related to the place. ASA is made up of the AODE and SELECT Applicable Only to Parallel
  Server. The AODE classifier is used to separate the data from smart city data based
  on the hybrid data obfuscation technique. The data from the hybrid data obfuscation
  technique manages 50% of the raw data, and 50% of hospital data is masked using
  the proposed transmission. The analysis of energy consumption before the cryptosystem
  shows the total packet delivered by about 71.66% compared with existing algorithms.
  The analysis of energy consumption after cryptosystem assumption shows 47.34% consumption,
  compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The average energy consumption
  before data obfuscation decreased by 2.47%, and the average energy consumption after
  data obfuscation was reduced by 9.90%. The analysis of the makespan time before
  data obfuscation decreased by 33.71%. Compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms,
  the study of makespan time after data obfuscation decreased by 1.3%. These impressive
  results show the strength of our methodology.
