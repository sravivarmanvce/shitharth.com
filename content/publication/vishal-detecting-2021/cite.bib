 abstract = {Detecting impersonators in examination halls is very significant to conduct the examination fairly. Recently there were occasions of potential impersonators taking tests instead of the intended person. To overcome this issue, we require an efficient method with less manpower. With the advancement of machine learning and AI technology, we can overcome this issue. In this project, we are developing an AI system where images of students are saved and the model is developed using transfer learning process to get accurate results. If the student is an allowed one, it shows the hall ticket number and name of the student otherwise it appears unknown tag.},
