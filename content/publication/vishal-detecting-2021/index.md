abstract: Detecting impersonators in examination halls is very significant to conduct
  the examination fairly. Recently there were occasions of potential impersonators
  taking tests instead of the intended person. To overcome this issue, we require
  an efficient method with less manpower. With the advancement of machine learning
  and AI technology, we can overcome this issue. In this project, we are developing
  an AI system where images of students are saved and the model is developed using
  transfer learning process to get accurate results. If the student is an allowed
  one, it shows the hall ticket number and name of the student otherwise it appears
  unknown tag.
