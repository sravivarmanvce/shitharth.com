abstract: Every year, each solar panel suffers an efficiency loss of 0.5% to 1%. This
  degradation of solar panels arises due to environmental and electrical faults. A
  timely and accurate diagnosis of environmental faults reduces the damage caused
  by faults on the panel. In recent years, deep learning precisely convolutional neural
  networks have achieved wonderful results in many applications. This work is focused
  on finely tuning pretrained models of convolutional neural networks, especially
  AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet. Based on the performance metrics, SqueezeNet
  is used for training thermal images of solar panels and for the classification of
  environmental faults. The results obtained show that SqueezeNet has a significant
  testing accuracy of 99.74% and F1 score of 0.9818, which make the model successful
  in identifying environmental faults in solar panels and help users to protect the
  panels.
