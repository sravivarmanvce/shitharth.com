abstract: The creation of sensor-based software for health monitoring using Internet
  of Things (IoT) technology is the main goal of this project. The program’s objective
  is to continuously monitor human physiological data, including ECG, SPO2, heart
  rate, and respiration, by employing biomedical sensor networks. These sensors collect
  data, which is then processed by a processor and transmitted to an edge server through
  a transceiver. A node of corner facilitates for real transmission has processed
  each data will be patient’s phone and the clinicians’ LED display. To address the
  optimization challenge, the program utilizes a Double Deep-Q-Network approach, with
  parameters optimized using a hybrid genetic algorithm-based simulated annealing
  technique. However, healthcare records obtained from the sensors are susceptible
  to change due to environmental factors, leading to potential performance issues.
  In order to overcome this challenge, an optimization approach is employed to refine
  the proposed technique, ensuring accurate prediction of readings. The study conducted
  experiments to evaluate the program’s performance, utilizing various metrics and
  different parameters. The results to provide light on how well the program that
  was created for leveraging IoT technologies for health monitoring is working. This
  study presents an innovative sensor-based program for IoT technology-based health
  monitoring, which continuously monitors human physiological data. The program incorporates
  a hybrid optimization approach to ensure accurate prediction of readings, accounting
  for environmental factors. The proposed Double Deep-Q-Network and the evaluation
  metrics employed demonstrate the originality and contributions of this research
  in advancing health monitoring systems.
