abstract: Without integrating various sensor data sets, sensing information in the
  presence of leakage for large-scale pipeline systems is very challenging. A data
  fusion methodology, wherein more sensor data is merged to give relevant information,
  is necessary to transform the challenging process into a straightforward step-by-step
  operation. Ultrasonic sensors are used in stage 1 to identify any ambiguities in
  pipeline systems, and various sites are used to gauge the rate of leak detection.
  As a result, a novel model for estimating various types of gas leakage in pipeline
  systems is examined, put to the test, and contrasted. Five distinct scenarios are
  seen during the leakage testing procedure using data fusion, where the optimization
  is done using the fuzzy interface technique. This integration procedure detects
  leakage rates with high accuracy, and in every test instance, the best outcomes
  are obtained. Additionally, the predicted model can be used in real-time with a
  low failure rate of numerous sensors, with MATLAB being used to simulate the results.
