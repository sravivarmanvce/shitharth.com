abstract: textlessabstracttextgreater textlessptextgreaterThe security of the Internet
  of Things (IoT) is crucial in various application platforms, such as the smart city
  monitoring system, which encompasses comprehensive monitoring of various conditions.
  Therefore, this study conducts an analysis on the utilization of blockchain technology
  for the purpose of monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The analysis is
  carried out by employing parametric objective functions. In the context of the Internet
  of Things (IoT), it is imperative to establish well-defined intervals for job execution,
  ensuring that the completion status of each action is promptly monitored and assessed.
  The major significance of proposed method is to integrate a blockchain technique
  with neuro-fuzzy algorithm thereby improving the security of data processing units
  in all smart city applications. As the entire process is carried out with IoT the
  security of data in both processing and storage units are not secured therefore
  confidence level of monitoring units are maximized at each state. Due to the integration
  process the proposed system model is implemented with minimum energy conservation
  where 93% of tasks are completed with improved security for about 90%.textless/ptextgreater
