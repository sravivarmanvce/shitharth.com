abstract: Since the past decades, internet usage has become inevitable due to its
  tremendous applications in various fields. Due to this huge usage of network, a
  lot of security problems arise. Intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors the network
  events and filters the abnormal activities. While monitoring events, large amount
  of data samples are collected from sensors and the features are extracted from raw
  data which are required for IDS classification. This selection of best features
  from the raw data can be performed by the optimal feature selection method. To compute
  the detection accuracy, SVM classifier is used. The proposed model is tested using
  KDD99 benchmark dataset. Compared to other machine learning algorithm, the proposed
  method produced better results.
