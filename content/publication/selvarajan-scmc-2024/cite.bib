 abstract = {In this paper the importance of monitoring smart city with integration of sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) is discussed with establishment of node control process. To describe the feature of smart cities time measurements are considered with one hop distance between various nodes. Hence the system model is established for various parameters that are integrated with K-means algorithm for clustering and C4.5 for classification. As a result of combining the dual algorithms with system model it is possible to establish a secured state for each data with proper response factor. The major significance of proposed method is to introduce node point where all increasing queues in smart cities are controlled due to the information that is achieved from every data points. Moreover the improvement in projected model can be observed with four scenarios where security at every data point plays an important role at an increased level of 84%. In addition to security the amount of stable points is increased with reduction in disparities for about 2% thereby every applications in smart cities are monitored in a precise way.},
