abstract: In this paper the importance of monitoring smart city with integration of
  sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) is discussed with establishment of node control
  process. To describe the feature of smart cities time measurements are considered
  with one hop distance between various nodes. Hence the system model is established
  for various parameters that are integrated with K-means algorithm for clustering
  and C4.5 for classification. As a result of combining the dual algorithms with system
  model it is possible to establish a secured state for each data with proper response
  factor. The major significance of proposed method is to introduce node point where
  all increasing queues in smart cities are controlled due to the information that
  is achieved from every data points. Moreover the improvement in projected model
  can be observed with four scenarios where security at every data point plays an
  important role at an increased level of 84%. In addition to security the amount
  of stable points is increased with reduction in disparities for about 2% thereby
  every applications in smart cities are monitored in a precise way.
