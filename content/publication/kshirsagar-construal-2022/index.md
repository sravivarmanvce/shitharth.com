abstract: Cloud services are a popular concept used to describe how internet-based
  services are delivered and maintained. The computer technology environment is being
  restructured with respect to information preservation. Data protection is of critical
  importance when storing huge volumes of information. In today’s cyber world, an
  intrusion is a significant security problem. Services, information, and services
  are all vulnerable to attack in the cloud due to its distributed structure of the
  cloud. Inappropriate behavior in the connection and in the host is detected using
  intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the cloud. DDoS attacks are difficult to protect
  against since they produce massive volumes of harmful information on the network.
  This assault forces the cloud services to become unavailable to target consumers,
  which depletes computer resources and leaves the provider exposed to massive financial
  and reputational losses. Cyber-analyst data mining techniques may assist in intrusion
  detection. Machine learning techniques are used to create many strategies. Attribute
  selection techniques are also vital in keeping the dataset’s dimensionality low.
  In this study, one method is provided, and the dataset is taken from the NSL-KDD
  dataset. In the first strategy, a filtering method called learning vector quantization
  (LVQ) is used, and in the second strategy, a dimensionality-simplifying method called
  PCA. The selected attributes from each technique are used for categorization before
  being tested against a DoS attack. This recent study shows that an LVQ-based SVM
  performs better than the competition in detecting threats.
