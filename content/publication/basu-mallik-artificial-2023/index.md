abstract: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a data processing paradigm inspired
  by the way organic nervous systems, such as the brain, process data. The innovative
  structure of the information processing system is a crucial component of this paradigm.
  It is made up of a huge number of highly linked processing components (neurons)
  that work together to solve issues. Neural networks handle data in the same manner
  that the human brain does. The network is made up of several densely linked processing
  units (neurons) that operate in parallel to solve a given problem. They are unable
  to be programmed to execute a specific activity. ANN, like humans, learns by example.
  Through a learning process, an ANN is trained for a specific application, such as
  pattern recognition or data categorization. In biological systems, learning includes
  changes to the synaptic connections that occur between neurons. This is also true
  for ANNs. Artificial Neural Networks are used for classification, regression, and
  grouping. Stages of image processing are classified as preprocessing, feature extraction,
  and classification. It can be utilized later in the process. ANN should be provided
  with features and output should be classified. This paper provides an overview of
  Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), their operation, and training. It also explains
  the application and its benefits. Artificial Neural Network has been used to classify
  the MNIST dataset.
