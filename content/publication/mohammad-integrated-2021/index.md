abstract: The problem of phishing attacks in enterprise is next issue rising in wide
  scale and complexity, as phishers use email phishing via obfuscated, malicious or
  phished URLs and continuously adapt or innovate their strategies to lure victims.
  To gain trust and confidence of victim’s phishers have started using visceral factors
  and Familiarity cues. Although in most cases a phisher’s clear motive is to commit
  identity theft in order to benefit from it financially; it is wrong to assume that
  phishing is always money centric. A phisher can also rob an internet user of his
  goodwill and character. There are no limits to what a phisher can do in such a scenario.
  Earning a bad name for oneself in a professional or academic arena can prove much
  more traumatic than being embarrassed at a social networking site. It is a challenging
  task to address this issue. It is evident through extensive literature review that
  single phishing detection filter approaches are insufficient to detect different
  categories of phishing attempts in enterprise environ. Therefore, a novel anti-phishing
  model for enterprise using artificial neural network is proposed. In addition, this
  model effectively identifies whether the phishing email is known phishing or unknown
  phishing to reduce the trust and familiarity-based email phishing enterprise environ.
  The Feed-Forward Backpropagation and Levenberg- Marquart methods of Artificial Neural
  Network (ANN) are adopted to enhance the URL classification process and with Fuzzy
  Inference System to get result with imprecise data of social features. The proposed
  model can accurately classify the known and unknown email phishing via URLs.
