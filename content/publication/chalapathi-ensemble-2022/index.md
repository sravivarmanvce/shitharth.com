abstract: In the recent past, handling the high dimensionality demonstrated in the
  auditory features of speech signals has been a primary focus for machine learning
  (ML-)based emotion recognition. The incorporation of high-dimensional characteristics
  in training datasets in the learning phase of ML models influences contemporary
  approaches to emotion prediction with significant false alerting. The curse of the
  excessive dimensionality of the training corpus is addressed in the majority of
  contemporary models. Modern models, on the other hand, place a greater emphasis
  on merging many classifiers, which can only increase emotion recognition accuracy
  even when the training corpus contains high-dimensional data points. “Ensemble Learning
  by High-Dimensional Acoustic Features (EL-HDAF)” is an innovative ensemble model
  that leverages the diversity assessment of feature values spanned over diversified
  classes to recommend the best features. Furthermore, the proposed technique employs
  a one-of-a-kind clustering process to limit the impact of high-dimensional feature
  values. The experimental inquiry evaluates and compares emotion forecasting using
  spoken audio data to current methods that use machine learning for emotion recognition.
  Fourfold cross-validation is used for performance analysis with the standard data
  corpus.
