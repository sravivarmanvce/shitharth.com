 abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become a promising enabler for the next generation of wireless networks with the tremendous growth in electronics and communications. The application of UAV communications comprises messages relying on coverage extension for transmission networks after disasters, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and dispatching distress messages from the device positioned within the coverage hole to the emergency centre. But there are some problems in enhancing UAV clustering and scene classification using deep learning approaches for enhancing performance. This article presents a new White Shark Optimizer with Optimal Deep Learning based Effective Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Communication and Scene Classification (WSOODL-UAVCSC) technique. UAV clustering and scene categorization present many deep learning challenges in disaster management: scene understanding complexity, data variability and abundance, visual data feature extraction, nonlinear and high-dimensional data, adaptability and generalization, real-time decision making, UAV clustering optimization, sparse and incomplete data. the need to handle complex, high-dimensional data, adapt to changing environments, and make quick, correct decisions in critical situations drives deep learning in UAV clustering and scene categorization. The purpose of the WSOODL-UAVCSC technique is to cluster the UAVs for effective communication and scene classification. The WSO algorithm is utilized for the optimization of the UAV clustering process and enables to accomplish effective communication and interaction in the network. With dynamic adjustment of the clustering, the WSO algorithm improves the performance and robustness of the UAV system. For the scene classification process, the WSOODL-UAVCSC technique involves capsule network (CapsNet) feature extraction, marine predators algorithm (MPA) based hyperparameter tuning, and echo state network (ESN) classification. A wide-ranging simulation analysis was conducted to validate the enriched performance of the WSOODL-UAVCSC approach. Extensive result analysis pointed out the enhanced performance of the WSOODL-UAVCSC method over other existing techniques. The WSOODL-UAVCSC method achieved an accuracy of 99.12%, precision of 97.45%, recall of 98.90%, and F1-score of 98.10% when compared to other existing techniques.},
