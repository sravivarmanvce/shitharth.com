abstract: The advancement of information technology, the Internet of Things (IoT),
  and several miniaturize equipment's enhances the healthcare field that provides
  real-time patient monitoring, which helps to provide medication anywhere and anytime.
  However, accurate detection is still a challenging task for which an effective classification
  model is introduced in this research. The proposed method is the Enhanced Hunt optimization
  based Deep convolutional neural network (Enhanced Hunt based-Deep CNN), in which
  the Enhanced Hunt optimization algorithm (EHOA) is developed by fusing the hunting
  habit of the predator and the herding characteristics of herding dog for enhancing
  the global optimal convergence. Here, the ECG signal from the individuals is collected
  using the IoT network and stored in the Hospital server, which is accessed by the
  doctor when requested, the classification is performed using the Enhanced Hunt based-Deep
  CNN and the performance revealed the effectiveness with the accuracy, sensitivity,
  and specificity of 95.33%, 94.92%, and 97.57%.
