abstract: Multiple Face Detection may be a process of identifying or recognizing quite
  one face on a picture. Face detections have recently attracted increasing interests
  thanks to the multitude of applications that end in format. There are numerous methods
  for identifying the face on the image but here we are using ‘Haar-AdaBoost’, ‘LBP-AdaBoost’,
  and ‘Neural Networks’ for identifying the faces on the image. And also we are comparing
  each of the methods to urge which method is giving highly accurate results and which
  method is giving results very quickly. In humans, by seeing the positions of Eyes,
  Nose, and Mouth another person can identify the face. The neural mechanism within
  the brain controls these all and provides the result. We are implementing an equivalent
  concept on the machine so that the machine can identify the faces by using the positions
  of the Eyes, Nose, and Mouth. The machine will identify quite one face or multiple
  faces within the image by using this, and that we also can compare which algorithm
  will provide a good percentage of accurate results.
