abstract: In all developing countries, the application of biomedical signals has been
  growing, and there is a potential interest to apply it to healthcare management
  systems. However, with the existing infrastructure, the system will not provide
  high-end support for the transfer of signals by using a communication medium, as
  biomedical signals need to be classified at appropriate stages. Therefore, this
  article addresses the issues of physical infrastructure, using Hadoop-based systems
  where a four-layer model is created. The four-layer model is integrated with Fuzzy
  Interface System Algorithm (FISA) with low robustness, and data transfers in these
  layers are carried out with reference health data that are collected at various
  treatment centers. The performance of this new flanged system model aims to minimize
  the loss functionalities that are present in biomedical signals, and an activation
  function is introduced at the middle stages. The effectiveness of the proposed model
  is simulated by using MATLAB, using a biomedical signal processing toolbox, where
  the performance of FISA proves to be better in terms of signal strength, distance,
  and cost. As a comparative outcome, the proposed method overlooks the conventional
  methods for an average percentage of 78% in real-time conditions.
