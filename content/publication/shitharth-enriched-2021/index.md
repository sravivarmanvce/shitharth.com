abstract: Providing security to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
  systems is one of the demanding and crucial tasks in recent days, due to the different
  types of attacks on the network. For this purpose, there are different types of
  attack detection and classification methodologies have been developed in the conventional
  works. But it limits with the issues like high complexity in design, misclassification
  results, increased error rate, and reduced detection efficiency. In order to solve
  these issues, this paper aims to develop an advanced machine learning models for
  improving the SCADA security. This work comprises the stages of preprocessing, clustering,
  feature selection, and classification. At first, the Markov Chain Clustering (MCC)
  model is implemented to cluster the network data by normalizing the feature values.
  Then, the Rapid Probabilistic Correlated Optimization (RPCO) mechanism is employed
  to select the optimal features by computing the matching score and likelihood of
  particles. Finally, the Block Correlated Neural Network (BCNN) technique is employed
  to classify the predicted label, where the relevancy score is computed by using
  the kernel function with the feature points. During experimentation, there are different
  performance indicators have been used to validate the results of proposed attack
  detection mechanisms. Also, the obtained results are compared with the RPCO-BCNN
  mechanism for proving the superiority of the proposed attack detection system.
