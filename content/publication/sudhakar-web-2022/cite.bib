 abstract = {In today's technology-driven world, a user profile is a virtual representation of each user, containing various user information such as personal, interest and preference data. These profiles are the result of a user profiling process and are essential to personalizing the service. As the amount of information available on the Internet increases and the number of different users, customization becomes a priority. Due to the large amount of information available on the Internet, referral systems that aim to provide relevant information to users are becoming increasingly important and popular. Various methods, methodologies and algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the user analysis process. Creating automated user profiles is a big challenge in creating adaptive customized applications. In this work proposed the method, Long Short-Term Architecture (LSTM) is User profile is an important issue for both information and service customization. Based on the original information, the user's topic preference and text emotional features into attention information and combines various formats and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models to describe and predict the elements of informal community clients. At last, the trial consequences of different gatherings show that the concern-based LSTM model proposed can accomplish improved results than the right now regularly involved strategies in recognizing client character qualities, and the model has great speculation, which implies that it has this capacity.},
