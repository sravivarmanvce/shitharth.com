abstract: In today's technology-driven world, a user profile is a virtual representation
  of each user, containing various user information such as personal, interest and
  preference data. These profiles are the result of a user profiling process and are
  essential to personalizing the service. As the amount of information available on
  the Internet increases and the number of different users, customization becomes
  a priority. Due to the large amount of information available on the Internet, referral
  systems that aim to provide relevant information to users are becoming increasingly
  important and popular. Various methods, methodologies and algorithms have been proposed
  in the literature for the user analysis process. Creating automated user profiles
  is a big challenge in creating adaptive customized applications. In this work proposed
  the method, Long Short-Term Architecture (LSTM) is User profile is an important
  issue for both information and service customization. Based on the original information,
  the user's topic preference and text emotional features into attention information
  and combines various formats and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models to describe
  and predict the elements of informal community clients. At last, the trial consequences
  of different gatherings show that the concern-based LSTM model proposed can accomplish
  improved results than the right now regularly involved strategies in recognizing
  client character qualities, and the model has great speculation, which implies that
  it has this capacity.
