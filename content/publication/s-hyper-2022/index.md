abstract: Many cutting-edge technologies with regard to agricultural applications
  are not being employed by farmers for a number of reasons, including the fact that
  each piece of designed equipment is manufactured for a specific utilisation mechanism.
  In contrast, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing techniques is expanding to
  deliver more valuable data at a cheaper cost. The hyperspectral images are created
  to operate in different locations using different band topologies, making the proposed
  model more practical and effective with the existing spectrum elements. Since flies
  movements are used to acquire hyperspectral images with straight-line perception,
  the proposed method also makes use of the bio-inspired Fly Optimization Algorithm
  (FOA). The functional efficacy, loss prevention, and error prevention of the FOA,
  which averages 83 percent, show that it is far better than current practises.
