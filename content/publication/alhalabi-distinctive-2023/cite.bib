 abstract = {More significant data are available thanks to the present Internet of Things (IoT) application trend, which can be accessed in the future using some platforms for data storage. An external storage space is required for practical purposes whenever a data storage platform is created. However, in the IoT, certain cutting-edge storage methods have been developed that compromise the security and privacy of data transfer processes. As a result, the suggested solution creates a standard mode of security operations for storing the data with little noise. One of the most distinctive findings in the suggested methodology is the incorporation of machine learning algorithms in the formulation of analytical representations. The aforementioned integration method ensures high-level quantitative measurements of data security and privacy. Due to the transmission of large amounts of data, users are now able to assess the reliability of data transfer channels and the duration of queuing times, where each user can separate the specific data that has to be transferred. The created system is put to the test in real time using the proper metrics, and it is found that machine learning techniques improve security more effectively. Additionally, for 98 percent of the scenarios defined, the accuracy for data security and privacy is maximized, and the predicted model outperforms the current method in all of them.},
