abstract: More significant data are available thanks to the present Internet of Things
  (IoT) application trend, which can be accessed in the future using some platforms
  for data storage. An external storage space is required for practical purposes whenever
  a data storage platform is created. However, in the IoT, certain cutting-edge storage
  methods have been developed that compromise the security and privacy of data transfer
  processes. As a result, the suggested solution creates a standard mode of security
  operations for storing the data with little noise. One of the most distinctive findings
  in the suggested methodology is the incorporation of machine learning algorithms
  in the formulation of analytical representations. The aforementioned integration
  method ensures high-level quantitative measurements of data security and privacy.
  Due to the transmission of large amounts of data, users are now able to assess the
  reliability of data transfer channels and the duration of queuing times, where each
  user can separate the specific data that has to be transferred. The created system
  is put to the test in real time using the proper metrics, and it is found that machine
  learning techniques improve security more effectively. Additionally, for 98 percent
  of the scenarios defined, the accuracy for data security and privacy is maximized,
  and the predicted model outperforms the current method in all of them.
