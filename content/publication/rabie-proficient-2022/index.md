abstract: Smart grids are complex cyber-physical systems that incorporate smart devicesâ€™
  communication capabilities into the grid to enable remote management and the control
  of power systems. However, this integration reveals numerous SCADA system flaws,
  which could compromise security goals and pose severe cyber threats to the smart
  grid. In conventional works, various attack detection methodologies are developed
  to strengthen the security of smart grid SCADA systems. However, they have several
  issues with complexity, slow training speed, time consumption, and inaccurate prediction
  outcomes. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel security framework for
  protecting smart grid SCADA systems against harmful network vulnerabilities or intrusions.
  Therefore, the proposed work is motivated to develop an intelligent meta-heuristic-based
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) mechanism for securing IoT-SCADA systems. The proposed
  framework includes the stages of dataset normalization, Zaire Ebola Search Optimization
  (ZESO), and Deep Random Kernel Forest Classification (DRKFC). First, the original
  benchmarking datasets are normalized based on content characterization and category
  transformation during preprocessing. After that, the ZESO algorithm is deployed
  to select the most relevant features for increasing the training speed and accuracy
  of attack detection. Moreover, the DRKFC technique accurately categorizes the normal
  and attacking data flows based on the optimized feature set. During the evaluation,
  the performance of the proposed ZESO-DRKFC method is validated and compared in terms
  of accuracy, detection rate, f1-score, and false acceptance rate. According to the
  results, it is observed that the ZESO-DRKFC mechanism outperforms other techniques
  with high accuracy (99%) by precisely spotting intrusions in the smart grid systems.
