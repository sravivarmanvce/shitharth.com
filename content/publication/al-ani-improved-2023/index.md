abstract: In this paper, the application of transportation systems in real-time traffic
  conditions is evaluated with data handling representations. The proposed method
  is designed in such a way as to detect the number of loads that are present in a
  vehicle where functionality tasks are computed in the system. Compared to the existing
  approach, the design model in the proposed method is made by dividing the computing
  areas into several cluster regions, thereby reducing the complex monitoring system
  where control errors are minimized. Furthermore, a route management technique is
  combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to transmit the data to appropriate
  central servers. Therefore, the combined objective case studies are examined as
  minimization and maximization criteria, thus increasing the efficiency of the proposed
  method. Finally, four scenarios are chosen to investigate the projected designâ€™s
  effectiveness. In all simulated metrics, the proposed approach provides better operational
  outcomes for an average percentage of 97, thereby reducing the amount of traffic
  in real-time conditions.
