abstract: Numerous users are experiencing unsafe communications due to the growth
  of big network mediums, where no node communication is detected in emergency scenarios.
  Many people find it difficult to communicate in emergency situations as a result
  of such communications. In this paper, a mobile cloud computing procedure is implemented
  in the suggested technique in order to prevent such circumstances, and to make the
  data transmission process more effective. An analytical framework that addresses
  five significant minimization and maximization objective functions is used to develop
  the projected model. Additionally, all mobile cloud computing nodes are designed
  with strong security, ensuring that all the resources are allocated appropriately.
  In order to isolate all the active functions, the analytical framework is coupled
  with a machine learning method known as Decision Tree. The suggested approach benefits
  society because all cloud nodes can extend their assistance in times of need at
  an affordable operating and maintenance cost. The efficacy of the proposed approach
  is tested in five scenarios, and the results of each scenario show that it is significantly
  more effective than current case studies on an average of 86%.
