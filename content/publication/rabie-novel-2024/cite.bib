 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is extensively used in modern-day life, such as in smart homes, intelligent transportation, etc. However, the present security measures cannot fully protect the IoT due to its vulnerability to malicious assaults. Intrusion detection can protect IoT devices from the most harmful attacks as a security tool. Nevertheless, the time and detection efficiencies of conventional intrusion detection methods need to be more accurate. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a simple as well as intelligent security framework for protecting IoT from cyber-attacks. For this purpose, a combination of Decisive Red Fox (DRF) Optimization and Descriptive Back Propagated Radial Basis Function (DBRF) classification are developed in the proposed work. The novelty of this work is, a recently developed DRF optimization methodology incorporated with the machine learning algorithm is utilized for maximizing the security level of IoT systems. First, the data preprocessing and normalization operations are performed to generate the balanced IoT dataset for improving the detection accuracy of classification. Then, the DRF optimization algorithm is applied to optimally tune the features required for accurate intrusion detection and classification. It also supports increasing the training speed and reducing the error rate of the classifier. Moreover, the DBRF classification model is deployed to categorize the normal and attacking data flows using optimized features. Here, the proposed DRF-DBRF security model's performance is validated and tested using five different and popular IoT benchmarking datasets. Finally, the results are compared with the previous anomaly detection approaches by using various evaluation parameters.},
