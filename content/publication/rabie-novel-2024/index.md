abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is extensively used in modern-day life, such
  as in smart homes, intelligent transportation, etc. However, the present security
  measures cannot fully protect the IoT due to its vulnerability to malicious assaults.
  Intrusion detection can protect IoT devices from the most harmful attacks as a security
  tool. Nevertheless, the time and detection efficiencies of conventional intrusion
  detection methods need to be more accurate. The main contribution of this paper
  is to develop a simple as well as intelligent security framework for protecting
  IoT from cyber-attacks. For this purpose, a combination of Decisive Red Fox (DRF)
  Optimization and Descriptive Back Propagated Radial Basis Function (DBRF) classification
  are developed in the proposed work. The novelty of this work is, a recently developed
  DRF optimization methodology incorporated with the machine learning algorithm is
  utilized for maximizing the security level of IoT systems. First, the data preprocessing
  and normalization operations are performed to generate the balanced IoT dataset
  for improving the detection accuracy of classification. Then, the DRF optimization
  algorithm is applied to optimally tune the features required for accurate intrusion
  detection and classification. It also supports increasing the training speed and
  reducing the error rate of the classifier. Moreover, the DBRF classification model
  is deployed to categorize the normal and attacking data flows using optimized features.
  Here, the proposed DRF-DBRF security model's performance is validated and tested
  using five different and popular IoT benchmarking datasets. Finally, the results
  are compared with the previous anomaly detection approaches by using various evaluation
  parameters.
