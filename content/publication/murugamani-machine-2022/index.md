abstract: Monitoring systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless sensors
  are in high demand and give exact data extraction and analysis. The main objective
  of this paper is to detect the most appropriate plant development parameters. This
  paper has the concept of reducing the hazards in agriculture and promoting intelligent
  farming. Advancement in agriculture is not new, but the AI-based wireless sensor
  will push intelligent agriculture to a new standard. The research goal of this work
  is to improve the prediction state using image processing-based machine learning
  techniques. The main objective of the paper, as described above, is to detect and
  control cotton leaf diseases. This paper comprises several aspects, including leaf
  disease detection, remote monitoring system depending on the server, moisture and
  temperature sensing, and soil sensing. Insects and pathogens are typically responsible
  for plant diseases that reduce productivity if not timely. This paper presents a
  method to monitor the soil quality and prevent cotton leaf diseases. The proposed
  system suggested uses a regression technique of artificial intelligence to identify
  and classify leaf diseases. The information would be delivered to farmers through
  the Android app after infection identification. The Android app also allows soil
  parameter values like moisture, humidity, and temperature to be displayed along
  with the chemical level in a container. The relay may be on/off to regulate the
  motor and chemical sprinkler system as required by using the Android app. In the
  proposed system, the SVM algorithm delivers the best accuracy in detecting various
  diseases and demonstrates its efficiency in the detection and control by the improvement
  of cultivation for the farmers.
