 abstract = {Many researchers have been interested in healthcare cybersecurity for a long time since it can improve the security of patient and health record data. As a result, a lot of research is done in the field of cybersecurity that focuses on the safe exchange of health data between patients and the medical setting. It still has issues with high computational complexity, increased time consumption, and cost complexity, all of which have an impact on the effectiveness and performance of the complete security system. Hence this work proposes a technique called Consultative Transaction Key Generation and Management (CTKGM) to enable secure data sharing in healthcare systems. It generates a unique key pair based on random values with multiplicative operations and time stamps. The patient data is then safely stored in discrete blocks of hash values using the blockchain methodology. The Quantum Trust Reconciliation Agreement Model (QTRAM), which calculates the trust score based on the feedback data, ensures reliable and secure data transfer. By allowing safe communication between patients and the healthcare system based on feedback analysis and trust value, the proposed framework makes a novel contribution to the field. Additionally, during communication, the Tuna Swarm Optimization (TSO) method is employed to validate nonce verification messages. Nonce message verification is a part of QTRAM that helps verify the users during transmission. The effectiveness of the suggested scheme has been demonstrated by comparing the obtained findings with other current state-of-the-art models after a variety of evaluation metrics have been analyzed to test the performance of this security model.},
