abstract: Nowadays, integration of renewable energy source like solar, wind etc in
  the grid is encouraged to reduce the losses and meet the demand. However, the integration
  of these renewable sources, power electronic devices, non-linear and un-balanced
  loads leads to the power quality issues this motivated power researchers for the
  development of new controllers and techniques. This paper develops a soccer-league
  algorithm based optimal tuned hybrid controller for the unified power quality conditioner
  associated with the solar power and battery-storage systems with the Boost converter
  and Buck Boost converter. The UPQC simultaneously performs both the functions of
  Shunt active power filter and series active power filter. The proposed optimally
  designed controller adapts both the properties of fuzzy logic-controller and SOL
  algorithm tuned proportional-integral controllers. The Kp, Ki values of shunt and
  series controllers are treated as control variables, which are optimally tuned by
  SOL to satisfy the objective function. The key contributions of the proposed work
  are the reduction of total harmonics in current waveforms thereby enhancing the
  power factor, quick action to maintain the constant DC-Link capacitor voltage during
  the solar irradiation variations, elimination of voltage sag/swell/large disturbance,
  and appropriate compensation for the un-balanced networks and loads. The performance
  investigation of SLOHC was carried-out with four test studies for different combinations
  of unbalanced/balanced loads and supply voltage of 3-phase distribution network.
  Comparative analysis was carried out with those of standard methods like a genetic
  algorithm, biogeography-based optimization, and proportional-integral controllers.
  The proposed method reduces the total harmonic distortion to 2.06%, 2.44%, 2.40%,
  and 2.32% which are much lower than those of existing methods available in literature.
  The design has been performed on MATLAB/simulink software.
