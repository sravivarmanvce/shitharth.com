 abstract = {Nowadays, integration of renewable energy source like solar, wind etc in the grid is encouraged to reduce the losses and meet the demand. However, the integration of these renewable sources, power electronic devices, non-linear and un-balanced loads leads to the power quality issues this motivated power researchers for the development of new controllers and techniques. This paper develops a soccer-league algorithm based optimal tuned hybrid controller for the unified power quality conditioner associated with the solar power and battery-storage systems with the Boost converter and Buck Boost converter. The UPQC simultaneously performs both the functions of Shunt active power filter and series active power filter. The proposed optimally designed controller adapts both the properties of fuzzy logic-controller and SOL algorithm tuned proportional-integral controllers. The Kp, Ki values of shunt and series controllers are treated as control variables, which are optimally tuned by SOL to satisfy the objective function. The key contributions of the proposed work are the reduction of total harmonics in current waveforms thereby enhancing the power factor, quick action to maintain the constant DC-Link capacitor voltage during the solar irradiation variations, elimination of voltage sag/swell/large disturbance, and appropriate compensation for the un-balanced networks and loads. The performance investigation of SLOHC was carried-out with four test studies for different combinations of unbalanced/balanced loads and supply voltage of 3-phase distribution network. Comparative analysis was carried out with those of standard methods like a genetic algorithm, biogeography-based optimization, and proportional-integral controllers. The proposed method reduces the total harmonic distortion to 2.06%, 2.44%, 2.40%, and 2.32% which are much lower than those of existing methods available in literature. The design has been performed on MATLAB/simulink software.},
