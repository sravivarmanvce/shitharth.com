 abstract = {The cloud computing standards are gaining an increased research interest due to various benefits they offer. Though there are so many influences with cloud computing, security and privacy problems are various issues handling with the extensive adaption by the model. Malicious problem of service provider is one more issue which cannot be traceable by data proprietors. Hence, finding the appropriate solutions to these security issues at both administrator level and customer level is very attractive in various directions. Cryptographically enforced access control for securing electronic pathological records (CEASE) is formulated by extending the proposed ciphertext-based attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) with advanced encryption standard (AES) through limited-shuffle techniques. The main objective of CEASE is to provide data confidentiality, and access control limited-shuffle protects the data from inference attacks and protects the data confidentiality for hot data. In the next step, this research works design a multistage encrypt-or model by differentiating the users as public and personal. Two separate algorithms such as Vigenere encryption algorithm and two-fish encryption are applied in personal and public domain, respectively. Further, where, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm is also processed for clustering of users in the public domain by which the overhead decreases effectively. As a final system, this work develops an integrated framework by combining the CP-ABE with AES, multistage encryptor and limited-shuffle. As it is combined with individual methods, this method achieves an efficient performance in the provision of security and data confidentiality.},
