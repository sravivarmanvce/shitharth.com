  In the past ten years, research on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has
  advanced tremendously in everyday situations to deliver improved performance for
  transport networks. To prevent problems with vehicular traffic, it is essential
  that alarm messages be sent on time. The truth is that an ITS system in and of itself
  could be a feature of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which is a wireless network
  extension. As a result, a previously investigated path between two nodes might be
  destroyed over a short period of time. textlessstrongtextgreaterDesign:textless/strongtextgreater
  The Time delay-based Multipath Routing (TMR) protocol is presented in this research
  which efficiently determines a route that is optimal for delivering packets to the
  target vehicle with the least amount of time delay. Using the TMR method, data flow
  is reduced, especially for daily communication. As a result, there are few packet
  retransmissions. textlessstrongtextgreaterFindings:textless/strongtextgreater To
  demonstrate how effective the suggested protocol is, several different protocols,
  including AOMDV, FF-AOMDV, EGSR, QMR, and ISR, have been used to evaluate the TMR.
  Simulation outcomes show how well our suggested approach performs when compared
  to alternative methods. textlessstrongtextgreaterOriginality:textless/strongtextgreater
  Our method would accomplish two objectives as a consequence. First, it would increase
  the speed of data transmission, quickly transfer data packets to the target vehicle,
  especially warning messages, and prevent vehicular issues like automobile accidents.
  Second, to relieve network stress and minimize network congestion and data collisions.textless/ptextgreater
