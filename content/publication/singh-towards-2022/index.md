abstract: According to a report published by Business Wire, the market value of e-commerce
  reached US$ 13 trillion and is expected to reach US$ 55.6 trillion by 2027. In this
  rapidly growing market, product and service reviews can influence our purchasing
  decisions. It is challenging to manually evaluate reviews to make decisions and
  examine business models. However, users can examine and automate this process with
  Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a well-known technique for evaluating
  and extracting information from written or audible texts. NLP research investigates
  the social architecture of societies. This article analyses the Amazon dataset using
  various combinations of voice components and deep learning. The suggested module
  focuses on identifying sentences as ‘Positive‘, ‘Neutral‘, ‘Negative‘, or ‘Indifferent‘.
  It analyses the data and labels the ‘better’ and ‘worse’ assumptions as positive
  and negative, respectively. With the expansion of the internet and e-commerce websites
  over the past decade, consumers now have a vast selection of products within the
  same domain, and NLP plays a vital part in classifying products based on evaluations.
  It is possible to predict sponsored and unpaid reviews using NLP with Machine Learning.
  This article examined various Machine Learning algorithms for predicting the sentiment
  of e-commerce website reviews. The automation achieves a maximum validation accuracy
  of 79.83% when using Fast Text as word embedding and the Multi-channel Convolution
  Neural Network.
