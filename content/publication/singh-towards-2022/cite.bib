 abstract = {According to a report published by Business Wire, the market value of e-commerce reached US\$ 13 trillion and is expected to reach US\$ 55.6 trillion by 2027. In this rapidly growing market, product and service reviews can influence our purchasing decisions. It is challenging to manually evaluate reviews to make decisions and examine business models. However, users can examine and automate this process with Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a well-known technique for evaluating and extracting information from written or audible texts. NLP research investigates the social architecture of societies. This article analyses the Amazon dataset using various combinations of voice components and deep learning. The suggested module focuses on identifying sentences as ‘Positive‘, ‘Neutral‘, ‘Negative‘, or ‘Indifferent‘. It analyses the data and labels the ‘better’ and ‘worse’ assumptions as positive and negative, respectively. With the expansion of the internet and e-commerce websites over the past decade, consumers now have a vast selection of products within the same domain, and NLP plays a vital part in classifying products based on evaluations. It is possible to predict sponsored and unpaid reviews using NLP with Machine Learning. This article examined various Machine Learning algorithms for predicting the sentiment of e-commerce website reviews. The automation achieves a maximum validation accuracy of 79.83% when using Fast Text as word embedding and the Multi-channel Convolution Neural Network.},
