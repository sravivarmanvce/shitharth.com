 abstract = {Effective management and control of large-scale networks can be challenging in the absence of appropriate resource allocation. This paper presents a framework for highlighting the significance of resource allocation in mobile, wireless, and ad hoc networks. The model has been designed to incorporate a clustering protocol and a schedule-based resource allocation algorithm, resulting in the establishment of a multi-objective framework. The proposed framework places a significant emphasis on the allocation of energy and distance, with a focus on minimizing these objectives. Each node is separated into several clusters where individual energy is allocated and the cluster head in each cluster allows the nodes to communication with shortest distance. For the transmitted information the speed of transmission is maximized thus more amount of time period is saved where stability factor is maximized. To test the allocated resources in the network the proposed method compares and evaluates the parametric outcomes with existing method based on five scenarios. In the comparative analysis it is observed that proposed method can able to maximize the life time and quality of service for all networks with optimized range of 84%.},
