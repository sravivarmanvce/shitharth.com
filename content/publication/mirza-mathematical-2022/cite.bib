 abstract = {To avoid dire situations, the medical sector must develop various methods for quickly and accurately identifying infections in remote regions. The primary goal of the proposed work is to create a wearable device that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to carry out several monitoring tasks. To decrease the amount of communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under five different situations. In all of the case studies that were examined, the planned method performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods.},
