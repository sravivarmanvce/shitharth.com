abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) technology in various applications used in
  data processing systems requires high security because more data must be saved in
  cloud monitoring systems. Even though numerous procedures are in place to increase
  the security and dependability of data in IoT applications, the majority of outside
  users can decode any transferred data at any time. Therefore, it is essential to
  include data blocks that, under any circumstance, other external users cannot understand.
  The major significance of proposed method is to incorporate an offloading technique
  for data processing that is carried out by using block chain technique where complete
  security is assured for each data. Since a problem methodology is designed with
  respect to clusters a load balancing technique is incorporated with data weights
  where parametric evaluations are made in real time to determine the consistency
  of each data that is monitored with IoT. The examined outcomes with five scenarios
  process that projected model on offloading analysis with block chain proves to be
  more secured thereby increasing the accuracy of data processing for each IoT applications
  to 89%.
