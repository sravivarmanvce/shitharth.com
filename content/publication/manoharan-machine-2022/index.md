abstract: In this article, a contemporary tack of mental tasks on cognitive parts
  of humans is appraised using two different approaches such as wavelet transforms
  at a discrete time (DWT) and support vector machine (SVM). The put forth tack is
  instilled with the electroencephalogram (EEG) database acquired in real-time from
  CARE Hospital, Nagpur. Additional data is also acquired from a brain-computer interface
  (BCI). In the working model, signals from the database are wed out into different
  frequency sub-bands using DWT. Initially, updated statistical features are obtained
  from different frequency sub-bands. This type of representation defines the wavelet
  co-efficient which is introduced for reducing the measurement of data. Then, the
  projected method is realized using SVM for segregating both port and veracious hand
  movement. After segregation of EEG signals, results are achieved with an accuracy
  of 92% for BCI competition paradigm III and 97.89% for B-alert machine.
