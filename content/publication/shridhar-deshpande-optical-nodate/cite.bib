 abstract = {An embodiment of the present invention provide for an optical 3D Puzzle toy microscope apparatus including a light source, a base unit, a stage unit, an objective, a tubular assembly, an eye piece. In a preferred embodiment, light travels from the light source sequentially through each of these components, producing an image of the contents of a slide on the stage to a user looking through the Eye piece assembly. In the base unit, in place of a standard mirror which would direct the light vertically up into the scope along the Z-axis, lens disposed in the optical path of the microscope from a first objective lens having a minimum magnification to a second objective lens having a maximum magnification among the objective lenses which has a birefringent affect upon the light as it passes up through the Scope.},
