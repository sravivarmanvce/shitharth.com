 abstract = {Intrusion detection and classification have gained significant attention recently due to the increased utilization of networks. For this purpose, there are different types of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) approaches developed in the conventional works, which mainly focus on identifying the intrusions from the datasets with the help of classification techniques. Still, it is limited by the significant problems of inefficiency in handling large dimensional datasets, high computational complexity, false detection, and more time consumption for training the models. To solve these problems, this research intends to develop an innovative clustering-based classification methodology to precisely detect intrusions from the different types of IDS datasets. Here, the most recent and extensively used IDS datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS, and Bot-IoT have been employed for detecting intrusions. Data preprocessing has been performed to normalize the dataset to eliminate irrelevant attributes and organize the features. Then, the data separation is applied by forming the clusters by using an intelligent Anticipated Distance-based Clustering (ADC) incorporated with the Density-Based Spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBScan) algorithm. It helps to find the distance and density measures for grouping the attributes into the clusters, which increases the efficiency of classification. Here, the most suitable optimal parameters are selected using the Perpetual Pigeon Galvanized Optimization (PPGO) technique. The extracted features are used for training and testing the dataset samples. Consequently, the Likelihood Naïve Bayes (LNB) classification approach is implemented to accurately predict the classified label as to whether normal or attack. During the evaluation, the performance of the proposed IDS framework is validated and compared using various evaluation metrics. The results show that the proposed ADC-DBScan-LNB model outperforms the other techniques with improved performance outcomes.},
