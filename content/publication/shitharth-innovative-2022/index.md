abstract: Intrusion detection and classification have gained significant attention
  recently due to the increased utilization of networks. For this purpose, there are
  different types of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) approaches developed
  in the conventional works, which mainly focus on identifying the intrusions from
  the datasets with the help of classification techniques. Still, it is limited by
  the significant problems of inefficiency in handling large dimensional datasets,
  high computational complexity, false detection, and more time consumption for training
  the models. To solve these problems, this research intends to develop an innovative
  clustering-based classification methodology to precisely detect intrusions from
  the different types of IDS datasets. Here, the most recent and extensively used
  IDS datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS, and Bot-IoT have been employed for detecting
  intrusions. Data preprocessing has been performed to normalize the dataset to eliminate
  irrelevant attributes and organize the features. Then, the data separation is applied
  by forming the clusters by using an intelligent Anticipated Distance-based Clustering
  (ADC) incorporated with the Density-Based Spatial clustering of applications with
  noise (DBScan) algorithm. It helps to find the distance and density measures for
  grouping the attributes into the clusters, which increases the efficiency of classification.
  Here, the most suitable optimal parameters are selected using the Perpetual Pigeon
  Galvanized Optimization (PPGO) technique. The extracted features are used for training
  and testing the dataset samples. Consequently, the Likelihood Naïve Bayes (LNB)
  classification approach is implemented to accurately predict the classified label
  as to whether normal or attack. During the evaluation, the performance of the proposed
  IDS framework is validated and compared using various evaluation metrics. The results
  show that the proposed ADC-DBScan-LNB model outperforms the other techniques with
  improved performance outcomes.
