abstract: The applications such as the remote communication and the control system
  are in critically integrated arrangement. The controlling of these network is specified
  by supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This study discusses
  about the attack prediction and classification process by using an enhanced model
  of machine learning technology. The attack types are classified by the optimal selection
  of features extracted from the sensor data. In this, the features are labelled and
  cluster between the matrixes are extracted. These cluster forms the initial processing
  of attack identification which prevents the mismatched result. This clustering of
  data is performed by mean-shift clustering algorithm. From that clustered data,
  the features that are irrelevant for classification process is identified and suppressed
  by using the genetically seeded flora optimisation algorithm. In this optimisation
  process, the flora seeds are selected genetically to select best features. Then,
  from that optimally selected clustered data, the relevancy vector is predicted and
  the types are classified. The classification process is performed by the Boltzmann
  machine learning algorithm. The classified results of the proposed method for testing
  SCADA dataset are analysed and the performance metrics are evaluated and compared
  with the state-of-the-art methods.
