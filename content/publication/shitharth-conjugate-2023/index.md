abstract: Ensuring the privacy and trustworthiness of smart cityâ€”Internet of Things
  (IoT) networks have recently remained the central problem. Cyborg intelligence is
  one of the most popular and advanced technologies suitable for securing smart city
  networks against cyber threats. Various machine learning and deep learning-based
  cyborg intelligence mechanisms have been developed to protect smart city networks
  by ensuring property, security, and privacy. However, it limits the critical problems
  of high time complexity, computational cost, difficulty to understand, and reduced
  level of security. Therefore, the proposed work intends to implement a group of
  novel methodologies for developing an effective Cyborg intelligence security model
  to secure smart city systems. Here, the Quantized Identical Data Imputation (QIDI)
  mechanism is implemented at first for data preprocessing and normalization. Then,
  the Conjugate Self-Organizing Migration (CSOM) optimization algorithm is deployed
  to select the most relevant features to train the classifier, which also supports
  increased detection accuracy. Moreover, the Reconciliate Multi-Agent Markov Learning
  (RMML) based classification algorithm is used to predict the intrusion with its
  appropriate classes. The original contribution of this work is to develop a novel
  Cyborg intelligence framework for protecting smart city networks from modern cyber-threats.
  In this system, a combination of unique and intelligent mechanisms are implemented
  to ensure the security of smart city networks. It includes QIDI for data filtering,
  CSOM for feature optimization and dimensionality reduction, and RMML for categorizing
  the type of intrusion. By using these methodologies, the overall attack detection
  performance and efficiency have been greatly increased in the proposed cyborg model.
  Here, the main reason of using CSOM methodology is to increase the learning speed
  and prediction performance of the classifier while detecting intrusions from the
  smart city networks. Moreover, the CSOM provides the optimized set of features for
  improving the training and testing operations of classifier with high accuracy and
  efficiency. Among other methodologies, the CSOM has the unique characteristics of
  increased searching efficiency, high convergence, and fast processing speed. During
  the evaluation, the different types of cyber-threat datasets are considered for
  testing and validation, and the results are compared with the recent state-of-the-art
  model approaches.
