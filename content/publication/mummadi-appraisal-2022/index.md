abstract: In this computerized era, cyber-attacks have turned quite common. Every
  year, the number of cyber-attacks escalates, and so does the austerity of the harm.
  In today’s digital environment, ensuring security against cyber-attacks has become
  important. Networking is becoming more sophisticated over time, and as the popularity
  of a successful technology grows, intrusion detection system security issues grow
  as well. There is a strong necessity for a solid defense in today’s cyber world.
  New attacks and malware pose a great challenge to the security community. Various
  machine learning techniques are being used in many intrusion detection systems to
  counter such attacks. Machine learning can learn on its own with minimal human interaction.
  Hence, it is vital to call for further attention to security concerns and associated
  machine learning defensive strategies, which inspires this paper’s complete survey.
  A thorough survey on diverse machine learning algorithms has been investigated in
  this paper to determine which algorithm is best suited for a specific attack; these
  techniques have been examined and compared in terms of their accuracy in detecting
  attacks.
