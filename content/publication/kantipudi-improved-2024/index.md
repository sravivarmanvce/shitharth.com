abstract: Detection and classification of epileptic seizures from the EEG signals
  have gained significant attention in recent decades. Among other signals, EEG signals
  are extensively used by medical experts for diagnosing purposes. So, most of the
  existing research works developed automated mechanisms for designing an EEG-based
  epileptic seizure detection system. Machine learning techniques are highly used
  for reduced time consumption, high accuracy, and optimal performance. Still, it
  limits by the issues of high complexity in algorithm design, increased error value,
  and reduced detection efficacy. Thus, the proposed work intends to develop an automated
  epileptic seizure detection system with an improved performance rate. Here, the
  Finite Linear Haar wavelet-based Filtering (FLHF) technique is used to filter the
  input signals and the relevant set of features are extracted from the normalized
  output with the help of Fractal Dimension (FD) analysis. Then, the Grasshopper Bio-Inspired
  Swarm Optimization (GBSO) technique is employed to select the optimal features by
  computing the best fitness value and the Temporal Activation Expansive Neural Network
  (TAENN) mechanism is used for classifying the EEG signals to determine whether normal
  or seizure affected. Numerous intelligence algorithms, such as preprocessing, optimization,
  and classification, are used in the literature to identify epileptic seizures based
  on EEG signals. The primary issues facing the majority of optimization approaches
  are reduced convergence rates and higher computational complexity. Furthermore,
  the problems with machine learning approaches include a significant method complexity,
  intricate mathematical calculations, and a decreased training speed. Therefore,
  the goal of the proposed work is to put into practice efficient algorithms for the
  recognition and categorization of epileptic seizures based on EEG signals. The combined
  effect of the proposed FLHF, FD, GBSO, and TAENN models might dramatically improve
  disease detection accuracy while decreasing complexity of system along with time
  consumption as compared to the prior techniques. By using the proposed methodology,
  the overall average epileptic seizure detection performance is increased to 99.6%
  with f-measure of 99% and G-mean of 98.9% values.
