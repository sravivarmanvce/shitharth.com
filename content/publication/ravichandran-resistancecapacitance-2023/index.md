abstract: The primary objective of this study is to delve into the application and
  validation of the Resistance Capacitance Optimization Algorithm (RCOA)—a new, physics-inspired
  metaheuristic optimization algorithm. The RCOA, intriguingly inspired by the time
  response of a resistance–capacitance circuit to a sudden voltage fluctuation, has
  been earmarked for solving complex numerical and engineering design optimization
  problems. Uniquely, the RCOA operates without any control/tunable parameters. In
  the first phase of this study, we evaluated the RCOA's credibility and functionality
  by deploying it on a set of 23 benchmark test functions. This was followed by thoroughly
  examining its application in eight distinct constrained engineering design optimization
  scenarios. This methodical approach was undertaken to dissect and understand the
  algorithm's exploration and exploitation phases, leveraging standard benchmark functions
  as the yardstick. The principal findings underline the significant effectiveness
  of the RCOA, especially when contrasted against various state-of-the-art algorithms
  in the field. Beyond its apparent superiority, the RCOA was put through rigorous
  statistical non-parametric testing, further endorsing its reliability as an innovative
  tool for handling complex engineering design problems. The conclusion of this research
  underscores the RCOA's strong performance in terms of reliability and precision,
  particularly in tackling constrained engineering design optimization challenges.
  This statement, derived from the systematic study, strengthens RCOA's position as
  a potentially transformative tool in the mathematical optimization landscape. It
  also paves the way for further exploration and adaptation of physics-inspired algorithms
  in the broader realm of optimization problems.
