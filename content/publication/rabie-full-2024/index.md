abstract: The dynamic connectivity and functionality of sensors has revolutionized
  remote monitoring applications thanks to the combination of IoT and wireless sensor
  networks (WSNs). Wearable wireless medical sensor nodes allow continuous monitoring
  by amassing physiological data, which is very useful in healthcare applications.
  These text data are then sent to doctors via IoT devices so they can make an accurate
  diagnosis as soon as possible. However, the transmission of medical text data is
  extremely vulnerable to security and privacy assaults due to the open nature of
  the underlying communication medium. Therefore, a certificate-less aggregation-based
  signature system has been proposed as a solution to the issue by using elliptic
  curve public key cryptography (ECC) which allows for a highly effective technique.
  The cost of computing has been reduced by 93% due to the incorporation of aggregation
  technology. The communication cost is 400 bits which is a significant reduction
  when compared with its counterparts. The results of the security analysis show that
  the scheme is robust against forging, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  The primary innovation is that the time required for signature verification can
  be reduced by using point addition and aggregation. In addition, it does away with
  the reliance on a centralized medical server in order to do verification. By taking
  a distributed approach, it is able to fully preserve user privacy, proving its superiority.
