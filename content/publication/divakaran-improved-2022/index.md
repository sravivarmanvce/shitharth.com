abstract: Authentication is a suitable form of restricting the network from different
  types of attacks, especially in case of fifth-generation telecommunication networks,
  especially in healthcare applications. The handover and authentication mechanism
  are one such type that enables mitigation of attacks in health-related services.
  In this paper, we model an evolutionary model that uses a fuzzy evolutionary model
  in maintaining the handover and key management to improve the performance of authentication
  in nanocore technology-based 5G networks. The model is designed in such a way that
  it minimizes the delays and complexity while authenticating the networks in 5G networks.
  The attacks are mitigated using an evolutionary model when it is trained with the
  relevant attack datasets, and the model is validated to mitigate the attacks. The
  simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model, and the results of simulation
  show that the proposed method is effective in improving the handling and authentication
  and mitigation against various types of attacks in mobile health applications.
