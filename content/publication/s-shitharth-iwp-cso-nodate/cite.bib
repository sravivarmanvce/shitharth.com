 abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used in many applications includes power transmission and
distribution for situational awareness an,d control. Identifying and detecting intrusions in a SCADA is a critical and demanding task in 
recent days. For this purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the existing works. But, it has some 
drawbacks include, it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cant detect the encrypted date and it supports only for detecting 
the external intrusions. In order to overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo Search Optimization (IWPCSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main 
intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input 
network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized 
to select the best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the intrusions in a network are classified by employing 
the proposed HNA-AA algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of sensitivity, 
specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate.},
