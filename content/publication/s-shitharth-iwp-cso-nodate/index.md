abstract: "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used
  in many applications includes power transmission and distribution for situational
  awareness an,d control. Identifying and detecting intrusions in a SCADA is a critical
  and demanding task in  recent days. For this purpose, various Intrusion Detection
  Systems (IDSs) are developed in the existing works. But, it has some  drawbacks
  include, it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cant detect the
  encrypted date and it supports only for detecting  the external intrusions. In order
  to overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo Search
  Optimization (IWP\x02CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based Neural Network
  (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main  intention of this paper
  is to detect and classify the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization.
  At first, the input  network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes
  are arranged and the clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized\
  \  to select the best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally,
  the intrusions in a network are classified by employing  the proposed HNA-AA algorithm.
  The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms
  of sensitivity,  specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false
  detection rate."
