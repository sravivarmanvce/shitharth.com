 abstract = {Providing security to the healthcare data stored in an IoT-cloud environment is one of the most challenging and demanding tasks in recent days. Because the IoT-cloud framework is constructed with an enormous number of sensors that are used to generate a massive amount of data, however, it is more susceptible to vulnerabilities and attacks, which degrades the security level of the network by performing malicious activities. Hence, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is the most suitable option for healthcare applications because it provides the best solution for improving the security and reliability of data. Due to this fact, various AI-based security mechanisms are implemented in the conventional works for the IoT-cloud framework. However, it faces significant problems of increased complexity in algorithm design, inefficient data handling, not being suitable for processing the unstructured data, increased cost of IoT sensors, and more time consumption. Therefore, this paper proposed an AI-based intelligent feature learning mechanism named Probabilistic Super Learning- (PSL-) Random Hashing (RH) for improving the security of healthcare data stored in IoT-cloud. Also, this paper is aimed at reducing the cost of IoT sensors by implementing the proposed learning model. Here, the training model has been maintained for detecting the attacks at the initial stage, where the properties of the reported attack are updated for learning the characteristics of attacks. In addition to that, the random key is generated based on the hash value of the data matrix, which is incorporated with the standard Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique for data security. Then, the enhanced ECC-RH mechanism performs the data encryption and decryption processes with the generated random hash key. During performance evaluation, the results of both existing and proposed techniques are validated and compared using different performance indicators.},
