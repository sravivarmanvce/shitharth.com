abstract: Providing security to the healthcare data stored in an IoT-cloud environment
  is one of the most challenging and demanding tasks in recent days. Because the IoT-cloud
  framework is constructed with an enormous number of sensors that are used to generate
  a massive amount of data, however, it is more susceptible to vulnerabilities and
  attacks, which degrades the security level of the network by performing malicious
  activities. Hence, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is the most suitable
  option for healthcare applications because it provides the best solution for improving
  the security and reliability of data. Due to this fact, various AI-based security
  mechanisms are implemented in the conventional works for the IoT-cloud framework.
  However, it faces significant problems of increased complexity in algorithm design,
  inefficient data handling, not being suitable for processing the unstructured data,
  increased cost of IoT sensors, and more time consumption. Therefore, this paper
  proposed an AI-based intelligent feature learning mechanism named Probabilistic
  Super Learning- (PSL-) Random Hashing (RH) for improving the security of healthcare
  data stored in IoT-cloud. Also, this paper is aimed at reducing the cost of IoT
  sensors by implementing the proposed learning model. Here, the training model has
  been maintained for detecting the attacks at the initial stage, where the properties
  of the reported attack are updated for learning the characteristics of attacks.
  In addition to that, the random key is generated based on the hash value of the
  data matrix, which is incorporated with the standard Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  (ECC) technique for data security. Then, the enhanced ECC-RH mechanism performs
  the data encryption and decryption processes with the generated random hash key.
  During performance evaluation, the results of both existing and proposed techniques
  are validated and compared using different performance indicators.
