 abstract = {Cloud computing provides so many groundbreaking advantages over native computing servers like to improve capacity and decrease costs, but meanwhile, it carries many security issues also. In this paper, we find the feasible security attacks made about cloud computing, including Wrapping, Browser Malware-Injection and Flooding attacks, and also problems caused by accountability checking. We have also analyzed the honey pot attack and its procedural intrusion way into the system. This paper on overall deals with the most common security breaches in cloud computing and finally honey pot, in particular, to analyze its intrusion way. Our major scope is to do overall security, analyze in the cloud and then to take up with a particular attack to deal with granular level. Honey pot is the one such attack that is taken into account and its intrusion policies are analyzed. The specific honey pot algorithm is in the queue as the extension of this project in the future.},
