abstract: Cloud computing provides so many groundbreaking advantages over native computing
  servers like to improve capacity and decrease costs, but meanwhile, it carries many
  security issues also. In this paper, we find the feasible security attacks made
  about cloud computing, including Wrapping, Browser Malware-Injection and Flooding
  attacks, and also problems caused by accountability checking. We have also analyzed
  the honey pot attack and its procedural intrusion way into the system. This paper
  on overall deals with the most common security breaches in cloud computing and finally
  honey pot, in particular, to analyze its intrusion way. Our major scope is to do
  overall security, analyze in the cloud and then to take up with a particular attack
  to deal with granular level. Honey pot is the one such attack that is taken into
  account and its intrusion policies are analyzed. The specific honey pot algorithm
  is in the queue as the extension of this project in the future.
