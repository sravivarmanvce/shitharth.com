abstract: Manufacturing, one of the most valuable industries in the world, is boundlessly
  automatable yet still quite stuck in traditionally manual and slow processes. Industry
  4.0 is racing to define a new era of digital manufacturing through Internet of Things-
  (IoT-) connected machines and factory systems, fully comprehensive data gathering,
  and seamless implementation of data-driven decision-making and action taking. Both
  academia and industry understand the tremendous value in modernizing manufacturing
  and are pioneering bleeding-edge strides every day to optimize one of the largest
  industries in the world. IoT production, functional testing, and fault detection
  equipment are already being used in todayâ€™s maturing smart factory paradigm to superintend
  intelligent manufacturing equipment and perform automated defect detection in order
  to enhance production quality and efficiency. This paper presents a powerful and
  precise computer vision model for automated classification of defect product from
  standard product. Human operators and inspectors without digital aid must spend
  inordinate amounts of time poring over visual data, especially in high volume production
  environments. Our model works quickly and accurately in sparing defective product
  from entering doomed operations that would otherwise incur waste in the form of
  wasted worker-hours, tardy disposition, and field failure. We use a convolutional
  neural network (CNN) with the Visual Geometry Group with 16 layers (VGG16) architecture
  and train it on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) dataset with 3175 RBG images. The
  resultant trained model, assisted by finely tuned optimizers and learning rates,
  classifies defective product with 97.01% validating accuracy.
