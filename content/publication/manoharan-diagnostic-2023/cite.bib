 abstract = {The process of using robotic technology to examine underwater systems is still a difficult undertaking because the majority of automated activities lack network connectivity. Therefore, the suggested approach finds the main hole in undersea systems and fills it using robotic automation. In the predicted model, an analytical framework is created to operate the robot within predetermined areas while maximizing communication ranges. Additionally, a clustering algorithm with a fuzzy membership function is implemented, allowing the robots to advance in accordance with predefined clusters and arrive at their starting place within a predetermined amount of time. A cluster node is connected in each clustered region and provides the central control center with the necessary data. The weights are evenly distributed, and the designed robotic system is installed to prevent an uncontrolled operational state. Five different scenarios are used to test and validate the created model, and in each case, the proposed method is found to be superior to the current methodology in terms of range, energy, density, time periods, and total metrics of operation.},
