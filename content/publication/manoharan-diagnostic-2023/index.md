abstract: The process of using robotic technology to examine underwater systems is
  still a difficult undertaking because the majority of automated activities lack
  network connectivity. Therefore, the suggested approach finds the main hole in undersea
  systems and fills it using robotic automation. In the predicted model, an analytical
  framework is created to operate the robot within predetermined areas while maximizing
  communication ranges. Additionally, a clustering algorithm with a fuzzy membership
  function is implemented, allowing the robots to advance in accordance with predefined
  clusters and arrive at their starting place within a predetermined amount of time.
  A cluster node is connected in each clustered region and provides the central control
  center with the necessary data. The weights are evenly distributed, and the designed
  robotic system is installed to prevent an uncontrolled operational state. Five different
  scenarios are used to test and validate the created model, and in each case, the
  proposed method is found to be superior to the current methodology in terms of range,
  energy, density, time periods, and total metrics of operation.
