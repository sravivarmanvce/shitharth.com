abstract: 'Purpose: In the contemporary era, a significant number of individuals encounter
  various health issues, including digestive system ailments, even during their advanced
  years. The major purpose of this study is based on certain observations that are
  made in internal digestive systems in order to prevent severe cause that usually
  occurs in elderly people.Approach: To solve the purpose of the proposed method the
  proposed system is introduced with advanced features and parametric monitoring system
  that are based on wireless sensor setups. The parametric monitoring system is integrated
  with neural network where certain control actions are taken to prevent gastrointestinal
  activities at reduced data loss.Results: The outcome of the combined process is
  examined based on four different cases that is designed based on analytical model
  where control parameters and weight establishments are also determined. As the internal
  digestive system is monitored the data loss that is present with wireless sensor
  network must be reduced and proposed approach prevents such data loss with an optimized
  value of 1.39%.Conclusion: Parametric cases were conducted to evaluate the efficacy
  of neural networks. The findings indicate a significantly higher effectiveness rate
  of approximately 68% when compared to the control cases.'
