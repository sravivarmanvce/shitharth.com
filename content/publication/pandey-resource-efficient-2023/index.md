abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in 5G networks has emerged as a promising technology
  to enable efficient and low-latency services for mobile users. In this paper, we
  present a novel synthetic data generation approach tailored for evaluating MEC in
  5G networks. Our methodology incorporates resource-efficient techniques to generate
  realistic synthetic datasets that capture the spatio-temporal patterns of mobile
  traffic and user behavior. By leveraging advanced modeling techniques, including
  multi-head attention and bidirectional LSTM, we accurately model the complex dependencies
  in the data while optimizing computational resources. The proposed synthetic data
  generator enables the creation of diverse datasets that closely resemble real-world
  scenarios, facilitating the evaluation of MEC performance and optimizing resource
  utilization. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach in enabling accurate assessments of MEC in 5G networks. Our work
  contributes to the field by providing a robust methodology for synthetic data generation
  specifically tailored for MEC evaluation, addressing the need for resource-efficient
  evaluation frameworks in the context of emerging technologies. The results of our
  study provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of MEC systems in
  real-world deployments.
