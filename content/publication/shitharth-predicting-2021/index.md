abstract: All COVID-19 affected countries putting their efforts to deal with the outspread
  of this death-dealing disease in terms of infrastructure, economics, medical treatments
  and many other resources. Nowadays, there are number of coronavirus analysis and
  prediction models are available to make decisions and to informed, aware people.
  But, absence of necessary data, these models are not able to show precise values.
  Based on the datasets, reports and on account of the uniform nature of the coronavirus
  and variations in its behaviour from place-to-place, this study recommend ML as
  well as deep learning as worthwhile tool to model the outbreak. To come up with
  for the well-being of living society, we prefer to utilize the ML and deep learning
  models with the focus for understanding its everyday exponential behaviour in addition
  to the prediction graphs of further growth of the COVID-2019 over the world by utilizing
  the available facts and dataset.
