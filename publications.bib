	abstract = {An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a data processing paradigm inspired
by the way organic nervous systems, such as the brain, process data. The innovative
structure of the information processing system is a crucial component of this paradigm.
It is made up of a huge number of highly linked processing components (neurons) that
work together to solve issues. Neural networks handle data in the same manner that the
human brain does. The network is made up of several densely linked processing units
(neurons) that operate in parallel to solve a given problem. They are unable to be
programmed to execute a specific activity. ANN, like humans, learns by example.
Through a learning process, an ANN is trained for a specific application, such as
pattern recognition or data categorization. In biological systems, learning includes
changes to the synaptic connections that occur between neurons. This is also true for
ANNs. Artificial Neural Networks are used for classification, regression, and grouping.
Stages of image processing are classified as preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classification. It can be utilized later in the process. ANN should be provided with
features and output should be classified. This paper provides an overview of Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN), their operation, and training. It also explains the application
and its benefits. Artificial Neural Network has been used to classify the MNIST
dataset.},

Economic growth and industrialization are proceeding at a rapid pace, accompanied by increasing emissions of air due to automobile vehicles, industries are the polluting sources. Environmental impacts of air pollutants have impact on public health, vegetation, material deterioration etc. To prevent or minimize the damage caused by atmospheric pollution, suitable RFID based cloud based monitoring systems are urgently needed that can rapidly and reliably detect and quantify polluting sources.\&nbsp;Cloud computing based IOT module attached with Nano sensor and frequency\&nbsp;identification emerges\&nbsp;together\&nbsp;to find the solution for the Air pollution control in automobile vehicles. All the pollution control monitoring data will be stored in common think speak cloud database. \&nbsp;The IOT based RFID sensor module is placed in toll booth collection centre and traffic light signal area. When the vehicle cross any traffic light signal and toll booth area by using our proposed project module it will check the pollution exhaustion level of the vehicle and update the information in the cloud database. If the vehicle exhibits more exhaustion of gas it intimates to the particular police station and to the owner of the vehicle about the over exhaustion of gases in his vehicle. In India Air Pollution realed issues are doubled every year due to increase in population. Here we tried to control the air Pollution caused by the Motor Vehicles related issues by the latest IOT based RFID technology using nano sensors. RFID reader and monitoring hardware is placed in all the traffic signals, Toll Gates and Parking areas. It reads the tag while the vehicle crossing the system and checks the date expiry of insurance and smoke test status. If any issues, it will alert the traffic moderators. Then necessary action will be taken by traffic and transport control department},

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is the centralized system that controlthe entire grid. When a system is considered to be a whole and sole control of huge grid then obviously anuncompromised security would be the vital. By having that as a major concern a lot of research is beingdone on IDS security. In spite of that it has several cons including increased fake positive and fake negativerates, which will invariably leads to a larger chaos. This research work is actually a prework to implementmachine learning algorithms in the SCADA data set to segregate testing and training data and to furtheroptimize. So a real time SCADA data set collected from the test bed is tested with two major tools netstatand snort. These tools helps in analysing the entire network traffic and it also helps in finding any anomaly /outliers present inside the network. This research work helps in scrutinizing the network data by finding outthe intruders not just stopping by that but also add the attack in the library database for future use.},

	abstract = {The problem of phishing attacks in enterprise is next issue rising in wide scale and complexity, as phishers use email phishing via obfuscated, malicious or phished URLs and continuously adapt or innovate their strategies to lure victims. To gain trust and confidence of victim’s phishers have started using visceral factors and Familiarity cues. Although in most cases a phisher’s clear motive is to commit identity theft in order to benefit from it financially; it is wrong to assume that phishing is always money centric. A phisher can also rob an internet user of his goodwill and character. There are no limits to what a phisher can do in such a scenario. Earning a bad name for oneself in a professional or academic arena can prove much more traumatic than being embarrassed at a social networking site. It is a challenging task to address this issue. It is evident through extensive literature review that single phishing detection filter approaches are insufficient to detect different categories of phishing attempts in enterprise environ. Therefore, a novel anti-phishing model for enterprise using artificial neural network is proposed. In addition, this model effectively identifies whether the phishing email is known phishing or unknown phishing to reduce the trust and familiarity-based email phishing enterprise environ. The Feed-Forward Backpropagation and Levenberg- Marquart methods of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are adopted to enhance the URL classification process and with Fuzzy Inference System to get result with imprecise data of social features. The proposed model can accurately classify the known and unknown email phishing via URLs.},

	abstract = {Smart grid doesn't have a single standard definition to define it. Commonly, Smart Grid is an incorporation of advanced technologies over the normal electrical grid. Smart grid provides some novel features that mainly includes two way communication and automatic self-healing capability. Like the Internet, the Smart Grid consists of many new technologies and equipment that are bind together. These technologies works with the electrical grid to respond digitally accordingly to our quickly changing electric demand. Even though it is stuffed with pros, it suffers a lot due to its fragile data security. Smart grid usually have a centralized control system called SCADA to monitor and maintain all the data sources. Attackers would always tend to sneak through this centralized system through numerous types of attacks. Since SCADA system has no definite protocol, it can be fixed into any kind of protocol that is required by the utility. In this paper, the proposed method provides two techniques one to detect and remove sniffers from the network. Another one is to safeguard the SCADA system from the DDoS attack. Promiscuous mode detection and MD-5 algorithm is used to find the sniffers and by analyzing the TTL values, DDoS attack is been identified and isolated. The proposed technique is also compared with a real time existing IDS tool to show its better bandwidth consumption.},

drawbacks include, it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cant detect the encrypted date and it supports only for detecting

intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input 
network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized 
to select the best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the intrusions in a network are classified by employing 
the proposed HNA-AA algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of sensitivity,
