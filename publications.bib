	abstract = {Smart grid doesn’t have a single standard definition to define it. Commonly, Smart Grid is an incorporation of advanced technologies over the normal electrical grid. Smart grid provides some novel features that mainly includes two way communication and automatic self-healing capability. Like Internet, Smart Grid also consists of many new technologies and equipment that are bind together. These technologies works with the electrical grid and respond digitally to our quickly changing electric demand. Even though it is stuffed with pros, it suffers a lot due to its fragile data security. Smart grid usually have a centralized control system called SCADA to monitor and maintain all the data sources. Attackers would always tend to sneak through this centralized system through numerous types of attacks. Since SCADA system has no definite protocol, it could be adopted with any kind of protocol that is required by the utility. Usually, there are certain tools which are commonly used in the IT and corporate systems. But how long it is compatible with SCADA network is always questionable In this paper, a comparison of countermeasure between the proposed methodology and the security tools (Wireshark, tcpdump) is been analyzed under Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) with Sniffing attacks . The security system apt for SCADA network is analyzed on the basis of bandwidth consumption and traffic analyzing capacity.},

	abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used in many applications including power transmission and distribution for situational awareness and control. Identifying and detecting intrusions in a SCADA is a critical and demanding task in recent days. For this purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted date and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo Search Optimization (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the intrusions in a network are classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate.},

The controlling of these network is specified by supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This study discusses about the attack prediction and classification process by using an enhanced model of machine learning technology. The attack types are classified by the optimal selection of features extracted from the sensor data. In this, the features are labelled and cluster between the matrixes are extracted. These cluster forms the initial processing of attack identification which prevents the mismatched result. This clustering of data is performed by mean-shift clustering algorithm. From that clustered data, the features that are irrelevant for classification process is identified and suppressed by using the genetically seeded flora optimisation algorithm. In this optimisation process, the flora seeds are selected genetically to select best features. Then, from that optimally selected clustered data, the relevancy vector is predicted and the types are classified. The classification process is performed by the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm. The classified results of the proposed method for testing SCADA dataset are analysed and the performance metrics are evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In the meantime, technology is reaching every domain. In the software industry, Automobiles, Education, Sports, Cinema technology is molding as a backbone to solve problems quickly and effectively. Technology is even used in the medical field. In pandemic situations, online medication is playing a crucial role. Technology can even be used in the agriculture field to identify crop diseases, which is a major problem for farmers. Even it spoils the environment to a great extent. Due to these, farmers are suffering huge losses. There are many reasons for this like the usage of more pesticides as these are very toxic and dangerous. If the diseases are predicted before, then these crop diseases can be removed or killed at the starting stage without causing much crop damage. Some people like experts can determine the disease by looking at the crop, that is by seeing external symptoms. But farmers don\&apos;t have the connection with the experts. Our project deals with overcoming this problem by using concepts of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The project goal is to predict crop disease. Farmers can use this project to predict crop disease at an earlier stage and get steps to remove the disease. We will develop an android app and a website that takes the cropped photo as input. Farmers should upload the affected crop images in the app, so those experts will observe the symptoms and predict the diseases. Here, the project interacts with experts and gets the required solutions. In the absence of experts, an Artificial Intelligence model is trained with the algorithm. This AI model learns from the images uploaded and the expert\&apos;s instructions to predict the output with more accuracy. Here the cloud is used to save images uploaded by users. AI models are subjected to a large number of datasets that contain disease data and predict the output. The output is then validated by experts to evaluate the correctness of the output.},

	abstract = {With the availability of the cloud storage services, users can store data to the cloud and have the access to share the data to others. The cloud file may contain some sensitive information, this information shouldn\&apos;t be exposed to others. The possible solution could be to encrypt the whole file which is shared before sending it to the cloud and to generate the signature to verify the encrypted file. Then, upload the encrypted file and signatures to the cloud. This enables the sensitive information to be private and only the owner can decrypt the file. Hence, it is not feasible to use by others. Distributing the decryption is the possible way to access it by others. However, it is not the efficient solution to implement this method in real scenarios. In order to overcome this approach, an efficient solution is implemented. In this new approach, sensitive information is kept private and can easily execute without any complications. Here, a sanitizer is used to sanitize the block which contains the sensitive information of the file. Firstly, the user binds the data blocks with respect to the sensitive information of the original data and generates a digital signature to that block and then sends it to the sanitizer. The sanitizer filters these data blocks and also sanitizes the data corresponding to the sensitive information. It also evaluates the corresponding signatures into valid ones. The signature is used to prove that the cloud truly possesses the data blocks. The third-party auditor is a public verifier, it verifies the data stored in the cloud on behalf of the user. This method supports the data sharing so that the sensitive information is protected in the cloud.},

Moreover, for proving the adeptness of the proposed method, the results are equipped in both online and offline analyses for investigating error measurement, sensitivity, and permeability parameters. Since nanosensors are introduced, the efficiency of the projected technique is increased by implementing media access control (MAC) protocol with recurrent neural network (RNN).

Cloud storage is managed by cloud service provider (CSP) being third party person to the data owners. Cloud storage consists of user's confidential data. After storing data in cloud, the owner of data cannot have control over data, where owner cannot trust the CSP because possibility of a malicious administrator. Based on this, different schemes are proposed. Security is a major concern for cloud stored data, and CSP has to provide trust to the data owner on security of the cloud stored data. In general, security to data and applications is provided through authentication and authorization. Security through authentication is provided by distributing user name and password to data users. However, the organizational user is not allowed to access all the organizational data. Authorization for accessing the data is provided by using access control models. Regular models are not enough to use the CSP based on the models uses dynamic method and proposed different models using attribute-based encryption (ABE). Earlier access control models cannot be used because of multiple disadvantages. This chapter will discuss dynamic access control model named as RA-HASBE. This model is proved to be scalable and flexible, due to sub-domain hierarchy. It is also proved to be dynamic by permitting user to access the data by risk evaluation using risk engine.},

Though there are so many influences with cloud computing, security and privacy problems are various issues handling with the extensive adaption by the model. Malicious problem of service provider is one more issue which cannot be traceable by data proprietors. Hence, finding the appropriate solutions to these security issues at both administrator level and customer level is very attractive in various directions. Cryptographically enforced access control for securing electronic pathological records (CEASE) is formulated by extending the proposed ciphertext-based attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) with advanced encryption standard (AES) through limited-shuffle techniques. The main objective of CEASE is to provide data confidentiality, and access control limited-shuffle protects the data from inference attacks and protects the data confidentiality for hot data. In the next step, this research works design a multistage encrypt-or model by differentiating the users as public and personal. Two separate algorithms such as Vigenere encryption algorithm and two-fish encryption are applied in personal and public domain, respectively. Further, where, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm is also processed for clustering of users in the public domain by which the overhead decreases effectively. As a final system, this work develops an integrated framework by combining the CP-ABE with AES, multistage encryptor and limited-shuffle. As it is combined with individual methods, this method achieves an efficient performance in the provision of security and data confidentiality.},

In spite of that it has several cons including increased fake positive and fake negative rates, which will invariably lead to a larger chaos. To get rid of these problems, a weighted-intrusion based cuckoo search (WI-CS) and graded neural network (GNN) methods are proposed in this chapter. The key purpose of this chapter is to identify and categorize the anomalies in a SCADA system through data optimization. At initial stage, the collected real-time SCADA dataset is given as input. Then, by using the aforementioned proposed machine learning algorithms, these data are clustered and optimized.

	abstract = {Multiple Face Detection may be a process of identifying or recognizing quite one face on a picture. Face detections have recently attracted increasing interests thanks to the multitude of applications that end in format. There are numerous methods for identifying the face on the image but here we are using ‘Haar-AdaBoost’, ‘LBP-AdaBoost’, and ‘Neural Networks’ for identifying the faces on the image. And also we are comparing each of the methods to urge which method is giving highly accurate results and which method is giving results very quickly. In humans, by seeing the positions of Eyes, Nose, and Mouth another person can identify the face. The neural mechanism within the brain controls these all and provides the result. We are implementing an equivalent concept on the machine so that the machine can identify the faces by using the positions of the Eyes, Nose, and Mouth. The machine will identify quite one face or multiple faces within the image by using this, and that we also can compare which algorithm will provide a good percentage of accurate results.},
